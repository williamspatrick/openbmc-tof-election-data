But I received only one answer that suggests pushing a patch myself to request a change.\n\n> https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/issues/33\n\nI found this issue you raised while trying to figure out what to do. That's why I involved you in. Because in our system, we have some important sensors that if missing, fans need to react and we want to use D-Bus config instead of JSON. phosphor-fan has phosphor-fan-control service to monitor events and set speed accordingly but it does not sync with phosphor-pid-control.\n\nThis patch of mine tries to align to the expectation in the issue because they make sense to me, too. However, the scope of the issue is big, not to mention that we just moved to phosphor-pid-control from phosphor-fan, and we don't use PID algorithm but just Stepwise, I don't have much of the knowledge to come up with something that can cover all the aspects. But I think `MissingIsAcceptable` should be what its name describes, in which `missing` also means when the sensor is not on D-Bus. Therefore, I pushed this patch to first address the problem that I'm facing. I'm OK that we can bring this patch to Discord again to ask for more comments.\n\nOne issue I see is that. When a sensor is purposedly built as failed because it's missing from D-Bus and it's not in the `MissingIsAcceptable` list. If the controller is configured with `InputUnavailableAsFailed`=false, the failed state will be bypassed. I don't know why it's a high priority to return false right here https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/951aff4cd1ba07f6d25400b7ac87621e76267eab/dbus/dbuspassive.cpp#L158.

It's a bug that they are different.\n\nAs for `MissingIsAcceptable`, the purpose of it was to allow PID loops to continue running, without throwing the PID loop into failsafe mode, if a constituent input was missing or malfunctioning. This is to cover the case of input sensors that are nice to have around, perhaps for faster thermal response, but not mandatory for correct thermal control of the system.\n\nAs for `InputUnavailableAsFailed` behaving the way that it does, the comment nearby that line tells the answer. The BMC will often remain powered up at all times, even when the host computer is powered down. However, when the host computer is powered down, about half the sensors will typically disappear, on a typical system. We do not want the fans to panic and enter failsafe mode just because these host-powered sensors are no longer showing up. When the host is powered off, there is little need to cool the system, so the fans can safely remain at their minimum speed. That's why we have this flag.\n\nAs you noticed, there's a difference between a sensor being present but malfunctioning, and a sensor that is missing entirely. Creating dummy sensors as placeholders might work well in some situations, but add unwanted clutter (think IPMI and Redfish sensor monitoring) in other situations. Regardless, design discussions are best had on that feature request, not here in a changelist.\n\nPerhaps a global compile-time option, not associated with any particular fan, might give people the chance to pick whatever behavior they prefer? We've done this for some other behavioral changes recently. Here is one example: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/+/68557\n\nIt's also key to avoid breaking existing behavior, even if the existing behavior is not as clean or logical as it could be. Reason is, people have real hardware running in real-world conditions right now, with this program running the way that it is right now. If we change things, we break a lot of behavior that people have depended on, even if they don't realize they're depending on it now. Such is life maintaining a mature program that has wide adoption in the field."

That's why we have this flag.\n\nI would argue that the `_available` variable is retrieved from the `Available` D-Bus property. `if (!_typeFan && !_available && !_unavailableAsFailed) return false;` => this line implies that if `Available` is false (usually updated from a propertiesChanged signal) and `InputUnavailableAsFailed`=false => this is NOT considered a failure. This is only valid if the host-power-dependent sensors are STILL on DBus and their `Available` is changed to false during poweroff. If they disappear during poweroff, signals are sent, (1) with the current behavior of D-Bus parsing method, swampd will rescan and ignore them anyhow, (2) with JSON parsing method, swampd is not aware of the disapearance nor any change to the sensor via propertiesChanged signal and it goes on => `InputUnavailableAsFailed` has no effect here;\n\nWith what I said, I'm confused whether the sensor with `InputUnavailableAsFailed`=false is supposed have the allowance to be missing from D-Bus, or to be `unavailable`?\n\nIt looks like `InputUnavailableAsFailed`=false is meant to override any failed case, the sensor can be missing anytime, even when swampd starts up with host-on, without affecting the zone.\n\n> Perhaps a global compile-time option, not associated with any particular fan, might give people the chance to pick whatever behavior they prefer?

But for Stepwise controller parsing, the DBus interfaces of each `Inputs` sensor are processed right after retrieved (https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/951aff4cd1ba07f6d25400b7ac87621e76267eab/dbus/dbusconfiguration.cpp#L1002). Idk why there's a difference here.\n\nMoreover, there should be just one object path with a specific sensor name on D-Bus. If there are more than one, according to the behavior of the current code, the last one will overide the previous ones in `sensorConfig`. Why don't we simply directly pick the last one and get rid of the loop through `inputSensorInterfaces`."
