I have an impression that (presuming bmcweb should be secure by default) the right way to solve the TODO would be to disable sending of all cookies, including isAuthenticated,\n\nSorry to cut in the middle of a sentence, but IsAuthenticated has no impact on the service security.  It is only a \"hint\" to the UI for the first load that it probably doesn't need to display the login page.\n\n> to discourage webui developers from trying to use mTLS altogether because with bmcweb as it currently is can not be made secure anyhow as it lacks any kind of CSRF protection for mTLS connections \n> (I couldn't find any specific guidance about this aspect of mTLS at OWASP but it's essentially the same as basic auth, if you allow basic auth for web browser you need CSRF protections).\n\nI'm not sure why you think they're similar, but they're really not similar at all, aside from the browser keeping a cache of each.  At a minimum, MTLS certificates have a valid by date and valid before date, that limit the exposure if they're leaked.  The certificate key itself is also never present on the wire as it is in basic auth.\n\nIf you're going to make statements about the security or non-security of bmcweb, please try to quote an authority on the subject (it doesn't have to be owasp).  Debating complex undocumented security principles in a code review isn't generally fruitful in my experience.\n\nThere are plenty of deployments where CSRF isn't necessarily required for MTLS, and to my knowledge, CSRF has never been enforced on a mutual TLS gui or in bmcweb, so that would be new, that I'm happy to discuss in a patches that want to add that.\n\n\nThe goal here isn't to encourage or discourage developers from doing anything.  If someone wants the webui to work with mutual TLS, they'll find a way to make it work and test it.  I haven't seen that happen, so the best I can do here is _try_ to keep the code similar for the paths that used to work.\n\n\n> \n> And in any case when a code is touched which has security implications it would be nice to see what rationale, what idea was behind the decision to make it the way it is.\n\nThat's certainly something I try to ask for in reviews.  You are welcome to do it as well, although in this case, this was literally just removing extra things that were known to not be used (hence the TODO).  It didn't really have anything to do with security. \n\n\n> In this case you decided to leave the code sending the cookie as it was but it's not clear whether you considered security implications of that or not.\n\nYou mean the IsAuthenticated cookie?  That cookie has nothing to do with security, which is why it's not documented in the commit message.\n\n> If you see a practical way how webui can be improved to start using it without compromising security, an outline would be nice to have in a commit message.\n\nThat would be for putting in a commit message in a patch about improving the webui, or a mailing list discussion.  Any \"practical way\" i suggest would start by reading information on the topic of mutual TLS authenticated websites and APIs, but that's something anyone can do.\n\n> If you think that's not possible then why keep the dead code which can also encourage frontend developers to try using it without knowing it shouldn't be done?\n\nWhy wouldn't we encourage developers to add new things or fix bugs in existing implementations?"

That's because before the app wants to route to `/` https://github.com/openbmc/webui-vue/blob/master/src/router/routes.js#L94 it checks if the user was authenticated https://github.com/openbmc/webui-vue/blob/master/src/router/index.js#L22 and since there is (and there was) no cookie https://github.com/openbmc/webui-vue/blob/master/src/store/modules/Authentication/AuthenticanStore.js#L22 the router redirects to `/login`.\n\nIf this check is relaxed webui-vue starts being functional with mTLS (of course without WebSockets). My guess is that if the cookie was actually set webui-vue would work without changes but I haven't tried. I'd say webui-vue supported and still supports isAuthenticated cookie but bmcweb stopped sending it after some regression and that's why mTLS for webui-vue stopped working."
