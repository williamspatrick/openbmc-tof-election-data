At least that is what I read from the comment.

I also removed the option flag that guards the hypervisor code since it doesn't cut it and reverted some of the code to its initial state (renaming variables, swapping lines of code), to point out that practically only a relocation of code from the collection handler was done in this patch, to be as close as possible in line with upstream code. \nAs soon as there is clarification on how to deal with the hypervisor code, I will adapt the code in this patch accordingly. \nIMO this works best for both of us having the patch technically fixed but open for change once the decision is made on how to proceed with the hypervisor code. I then could move on to push the next patch regarding multi host support to continue our  discussion on the design. What is your opinion on this?"
