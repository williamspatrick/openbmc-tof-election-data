Currently I have a single bool which is tracking if this connection has been intercepted previously. If so, it does not attempt to intercept it again. Is there a better way to handle this? I wanted to check the cookies, but I couldn't figure out a good way to do that in crow.\n3. webui requires the username to be stored in local storage. To my knowledge, this is not something I can inject from bmcweb, so I believe this will require a change to webui?"
