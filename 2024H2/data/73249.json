Discord is generally a better way to get ahold of me.\n\nI believe bootstrap has dropped the dependency on jquery, so we can just use bootstrap 5 directly, no need for any vue specific package.\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/65547199/using-bootstrap-5-with-vue-3. Gives examples on how to do it.  Basically for each component we would disable compat mode, add bootstrap 5 under an alias namespace, then move the code over to use bootstrap5 instead of bootstrap-vue.  Do that one at a time per component, then eventually remove vue3.\n\nWith that said, I would like to see compat mode to master before we start doing that work, and to not start doing that work in the vue3 branch.  The vue3 branch is for doing the minimum possible to port to vue3, then once we believe it's stable and tested, then we can merge to master and continue doing the migration."

Because most of the props of the components and classes are similar.\n\nIn my opinion, \"minimizing change\" isn't a design goal.  If we move to Bootstrap-vue-next, we very likely will have the same problem we've had previously in the future, where the package goes unmaintained, and we are in the same boat again.\n\nDecoupling bootstrap from vue gives us complete control over what we do.\n\nWith that said, I'm not going to put forward a lot of patches in this regard, and I'm not a webui-vue maintainer, so if someone does the minimal Bootstrap-vue-next port, and the maintainers accept it, that's between the two of them.\n\nMy only goal in the vue3 port was to unfreeze something that seemed to have been stuck for years.\n\n> \n> After removing compat mode, we might still require some changes or fixes. So, Merging to master after removing compat mode and done with the fixes is a safer approach.\n> \n> Any thoughts?\n\nI don't really want to rely on \"might require some changes\" for making major refactoring decisions.  If things require changes, make the changes and submit them to review.  If we cause bugs, fix them or revert the patches that cause the bugs.  All of those things can happen on master, with the maintainers we have.\n\nGoing down the path of removing compat mode in the vue3 branch bifurcates the community testing, and delays integration, which is a far more dangerous problem than possibly injecting a minor bug or two in code that we've tested properly."
