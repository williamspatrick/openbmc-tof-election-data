I've posted concerns around doing this in separate apps here as well as in https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/46346. My suggestion would be implement this in openbmc/pldm, wherein PLDM Requester work is happening already (Type 5 commits are on Gerrit). We have plans on implementing Type 2 next, but I think your code can be easily migrated to openbmc/pldm."

The Fru information would be present in the frurecord Table of the remote PLDM terminus, and the FRU Recordset identifiers would be coming from the fru recordSet PDR's of the remote terminus - what is the role of the Entity association PDR's here ?\n\nThe proposal assumes tid is assigned by pldmd so pldmd knows the mapping of TID/EID. When pldmd fetches PDRs by GetPDR command from a PLDM terminus, pldmd also knows which EID returns the PDRs and what value of terminus handle is in each PDRs. So pldmd should be able to maintain a mapping table for terminus_handle/eid/tid.\n\nWhen pldmd parses the Entity association PDRs for a PLDM terminus, it can create dbus objects for all entities defined in PDRs in a hierarchical dbus paths(/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Source/PLDM/<TID>/<INSTANCE#>/<INSTANCE#>/...) and then implements Entity.interface and FRU.interface to these dbus objects.\n\n> Multiple PLDM entities from the same pldm terminus can have the same entity instance number. if that is the case, the dbus paths will not be unique.\n\nMy idea is that the instance# should be unique under the same container ID. The dbus path of child entity cascades its instance# after its parent's dbus path string.\n\nExample:\nA PLDM terminus assigned TID to 1. Its Entity Association PDR describes the containerID=123 under contrainerID=SYSTEM and there are two entities belong to containerID=123. So the dbus path for these three entities are created like below.\n\n/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Source/PLDM/1/\n/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Source/PLDM/1/1\n/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Source/PLDM/1/2"

For example - the devices with static PDRs can extend and support other type of static PDRs like State Sensor PDRs, Effecter PDRs etc.. This won't be easy to maintain in entity manager."

Yes, having the feature would be easier for writing config file for fan control(the temp inputs array of pid type property in entity-manager JSON file)\n\nWould it be okay to supply a config file to 'pldmd'? The config file defines rules how to mapping sensor# in a PLDM terminus to practical name. Each rule has FRU matching keywords like what entity-manager does. 'pldmd' can decide which rule should apply to which PLDM terminus. For the case that more than one the same PLDM terminus installed in platform, the sensor names for second and following terminus will be have a suffix instance# of PLDM terminus.\n\nThe cons: It is introducing another config file to increase maintenance effort.\nThe pros: It avoids the dependency on EM and the D-Bus calls."

Is there any mechanism to supply configuration \n> from EM (or provided in pldmd) to give better names on these?\nThe idea of using location decorator(https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Decorator/LocationCode.interface.yaml) mentioned by Sumanth might be helpful here. Since, PLDM will always have a transport layer below, it might be always good if that transport can give the information related to physical location of the device. And it is easy and straightforward for a transport layer to expose this info. \n\nEg: In MCTP over I2C binding, mctpd will have the information about the device slave address or bus number in which it is connected to. With an entity manager config we can easily name and map that bus as say 'PCIe slot 1' and expose it as LocationCode. Now pldmd can consume the same and prepend to sensor name, then fan control can easily map corresponding fans with the same.\n\nIf PLDM has static EID config, then this info can be part of that config as well."

It might be good to expose this info here to implement the idea of location decorator mentioned by Sumanth. \n\nIn MCTP over I2C binding, the Slave address for endpoint can be fixed or dynamic assignment(SMBus ARP). Entity manager config can easily map endpoint for fixed address but hard for dynamic assignment. If we can assumed that all PCI slots in system has its dedicated I2C bus number(might be connected to different BMC's I2C bus or divided by I2C-MUX), then using I2C bus number should be enough for pldmd to map sensor name."

But since mux address is static, entity manager can easily map the given bus address to PCIe Slot 1, PCIe Slot 2 etc.."

                    "message": "I think you're conflating things here. Why is the DBus path the only source of how things are named in the Redfish output?\n\nRegardless you now have several constraints you need to deal with:\n\n1. [Valid Object Paths in DBus](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-marshaling-object-path)\n2. [Sensor names in section 28.8 and effector names in section 28.15 from DSP0248 v1.2.2](https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0248_1.2.2.pdf)\n3. There's no specification for terminus names that I can find.\n\nFrom 1. DBus object path elements are constrained to the character set `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_` and path elements must not be empty. Further, the specification is clear on the behaviour of applications:\n\n>  Implementations must not send or accept messages with invalid object paths.\n\nFrom 2, the sensorName and effecterName field may be:\n\n1. Absent\n2. A null-terminated unicode string\n3. The null string (0x0000, UTF-16 (BE)).\n\nThis requires that:\n\n1. You do appropriate encoding and decoding of the character buffers such that we can handle UTF-16 BE and ASCII\n2. You mangle the name of the sensor or effecter to have it conform to the DBus path name constraints. You will need to specify a mangling behaviour. It should be possible to recover the true name of the sensor from the mangled name.\n\nRegarding 3,  Do we assume that terminus names are specified in the same manner as sensors and effectors? If so, we have the same constraints as above, which leads us to:\n\nYou're proposing a path encoding scheme that has ambiguities. As an application I may observe the following paths being published (among others:\n\n1. `/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/<sensor_type>/_`\n2. `/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/<sensor_type>/__`\n3. `/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/<sensor_type>/0_1`\n\nRegarding 1, under our assumption about the terminus name, it's unclear whether:\n\n- The terminus name is the null string or absent\n- The sensor/effecter name is the null string or absent\n\nRegarding 2, under our assumption about the terminus name, there are no constraints on the terminus, sensor or effecter name content, other than that it is valid UTF-16 BE. It's valid to call a terminus, sensor or effecter `_`. It's also valid for the terminus, sensor or effecter name to be absent. This leads to the ambiguity as to whether the first or second underscore in the object name is associated with the terminus or the sensor/effecter\n\nRegarding 3, under our assumption about the terminus name, there are no constraints on the terminus, sensor or effecter name content, other than that it is valid UTF-16 BE. It's ambiguous as to whether the values `0` and `1` represent the TID and sensor ID, or the terminus name and sensor auxiliary name, or some mix of the two, as the values may be either a string converted to a string (e.g. the string with UTF-16 BE encoding `[0x0030, 0x0000]` for `0`), or integers converted to a string. That may be pathological, but the ambiguity exists regardless.\n\nThis is all solved if we remove the flexibility of what you're proposing, and define the object path pattern as:\n\n```\n/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/<sensor_type>/$TID/$SensorID\n```\n\nFrom there we can host an interface on `/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/<sensor_type>/$TID` that exposes the terminus name, and the same interface on `/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/<sensor_type>/$TID/$SensorID` that exposes the sensor name. My proposal does not require a lossless mangling scheme and removes the ambiguities."
