I chose to implement it with a Numeric Sensor rather than a State Sensor because a Numeric Sensor's PRESENT_READING can support data types larger than 16 bits, allowing me to represent the PMBus status word with a single sensor. On the other hand, a State Sensor is limited to 8 bits (sensorOffset). Additionally, this mechanism does not involve thresholds, which is why it is not included in sensor/threshold.\n\nCould you suggest whether it's better to implement this using a State Sensor or use  OEM Commands to approach?"

Here, the state sensors refer to PLDM State Sensors:\n\nA PLDM state sensor that returns values from only a single state set is referred to as a simple state sensor.\nA state sensor that returns values from more than one state set is referred to as a composite state sensor.\n\nAlthough this is a standard feature defined in DSP0248, it seems that upstream OpenBMC has not implemented it yet.\n\nThe OEM Commands mentioned here refer to the approach taken by project yv4. Although I haven\u2019t studied it in depth, I\u2019ve heard that it uses an OEM-specific method, and the related yv4 code has indeed not been merged into the upstream."
