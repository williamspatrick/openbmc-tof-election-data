Basically I was trying to get at the fact that just because a server installs a component, and the server manufacturer uses that component in their designs, doesn't mean that manufacturer is the folder in which it goes.  My primary example of this was NICs, which is shot to hell, so I'll defer.\n\n> \n> > #3 reads in a pretty complicated way and I'd have trouble enforcing it.\n> \n> That's fair.

Sometime next year, I foresee our team doing a design and implementation for some kind of \"mixins\" that would allow some platform-level customization of common parts.
