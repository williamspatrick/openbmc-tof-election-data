So the primary inventory mechanism for this using EM is https://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/blob/master/configurations/minerva_fanboard.json#L1280. It gets probed when the EEPROM is found and a valid FRUID is read.\n\nOne minor problem we have is to recognize the difference between a misplugged or faulty EEPROM of the fan-board vs a missing fan-board.

Since it is not worth all that effort to make a special daemon and it is not needed for some components. But we still want the inventory and presence.\n\nSo the idea is for EM and some presence daemon to work together to accomplish what is currently being accomplished with phosphor-inventory-manager and a presence daemon.\n\nEM will be better for that use case since it can be dynamic. phosphor-inventory-manager only supports the static configuration."

I'm also not sure if all other daemons properly handle this property. So if there is a dbus object with an inventory interface, and Present=false, will it be detected as absent by the other daemons?\n\nFor the static inventory the 'Present' property seems to have worked out, but imagine exposing large amounts of 'possibly present' inventory objects in dbus, leading to dbus bloat. \n\nThen all the daemons have to query 'Present' property before proceeding with anything."

Your design should allow configuration to be exposed due to GPIO state (of the cable being presence) so that his daemon can consume the EM config for leaks reported by that cable."

That's from August 2020.\n\n> Entity manager shall not directly participate in the detection of devices, and instead will rely on other D-Bus applications to publish interfaces that can be detected.\n\nSo it's good to have the EM maintainers here to discuss this.\n\nIf EM were to directly use the GPIOs to detect hw, it would simplify the logic.\nBecause the gpio can be requested synchronously, failing if another program already requested it. So there would be no need to expose configuration, wait for the other daemon to generate the property changed event, and then proceeding to probe other things."

The 'gpio-presence-sensor' is not intended to expose configuration or inventory items. For the configuration, that is already exposed by EM. \nI would like to avoid exposing it as an inventory item because this interface will be used to probe the actual inventory item. Also to avoid anyone using this outside the intended context.\n\n- 2 Yes. We can rename to 'EntityPresence' which is more generic."

The existing design focuses only on cables, and focuses on the example of one gpio to detect a cable and make a cable inventory.\n\nThis design focuses on gpio based hardware inventory in general and not only limited to cables. The downside of this design is that it does not directly provide the cable inventory. It provides an Inventory Source on which to probe other configuration. Which may then provide the cable inventory, sensors and/or other things.\n\nThe main problems with the existing design is that it was not implemented.\nIt could have been easily expanded to multiple gpios."
