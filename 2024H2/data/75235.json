Because there's automated tests that have coverage of that code, so if it were broken, it would immediately show in CI.  To my knowledge, event service (the code changed here) does not have automated tests or unit tests like that commit does.\n\n> \n> For further examples of 'Inspection Only' we have\n> \n> 7945eeed0fe8f9c7bf07669294499ae0108da1d3 (Ed, refactoring)\n> d3e9c3a24a804d159b473002dfc99eb86ac3cd91 (Ed)\n> ac1e1246464e28fe4313ba936a6b8f64ec65bb12 (Ed)\n> f2a8e57ede74a8252100b2281e3f4d170aa69391 (Gunnar)\n> ...\n\nYou'll note that these each hit some combination of:\n- Code covered by redfish-service-validator, which runs automatically.\n- Either a net same or net negative code lines diff that's trivial to review.

Keep in mind, the inline keyword doesn't actually effect inlining anymore, it's just an indication that the same definition might show up twice.\n\n> In fact, I think most of functions of `Subscription` class becomes non-inlined with this.\n\nIs there a concrete reason that's a problem?"
