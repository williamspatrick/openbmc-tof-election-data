E.g. this ambient temperature sensor is monitoring this chassis. \n\nWe want to get the Chassis's total power usage in watts. We are trying to fill out \"PowerWatts\" in Redfish but this use case could be for IPMI or any other server management spec.\n\n> We're not going to make a bunch of custom associations.\n\nSure, we could hard code the sensor name, e.g. total_power, but then we end up with a bunch of custom names. I don't see that as being better but if that is the direction the community wants to take, I don't care that much. \n\n>  We already have a mechanism for documenting specific names for specific purposes. \n\nWhat is the correct mechanism for documenting specific names for specific purposes ?"
