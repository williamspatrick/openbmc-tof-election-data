They might match, and that's fine, but if this is an enumeration, it needs to be called out as such, and describe how folks can configure it.\n\n\nAs written, It could be a lot of things."

Anyhow...\n\nThe design suggests that we need both of them as a PLDM image identifier, which is the purpose of this configuration.  The reason is because we'd like to be able to differentiate (and block as necessary) two different images that work functionally on the same hardware but have not been qualified in different environments.\n\nFor an example I made up on the fly, we could have a different compatible of `com.meta.Hardware.Yosemite4.CX7` vs `com.meta.Hardware.Catalina.CX7` and ensure that the image that was qualified for Yv4 is never applied to Catalina, even thought it is the same hardware.\n\n(What I wrote above actually doesn't work today because the CX7 would have the \"Compatible\" and there isn't currently a way to tweak them per-machine; we might work on that next half.  We do have concrete cases of the same CPLD being used for different purposes and so while the VendorIANA would be the same we need to have different compatible identifiers so we don't end up putting one CPLD image on a different [purpose] CPLD and brick the whole device.)"
