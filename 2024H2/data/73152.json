My ultimate goal was to move the cable GPIO information into the entity manager (as it will be done by other design) and only keep the Inventory Item-related dependency in this configuration. I can update this config to reflect that.\n\n> You'd need some daemon to do the presence detect and put something onto D-Bus that EM could probe, so it could create the cable inventory interfaces.\n\nThat would be handled by https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/docs/+/74022, i.e. it would do presence detect for fixed hardware inventory (for example gpio for all cables) and create inventory interfaces. The purpose of this daemon is to check the inventory against the runtime configuration (for example, what cables are expected to be connected) and generate alerts if any items are missing."

But i am fine to make that change now. Will add details on what Detector related configuration can be exposed based on cable PROBES, although cable DBUS objects for PROBE conditions will be defined by the GPIO based HW inventory design. \n\n> \n> The major reason is the JSON config file method may break when you have to support more than 1 system out of the same flash image.\n\nSounds good.\n\n> \n> As for the target, in EM you may not want to hardcode a target name, but you could just make it into an enum, like: Action: HardPowerOffRack.\n\nSure."

You can look at that and see if it makes sense for a different repo.\n\n> \n> There's a significant update to Redfish coming to solve a lot of these interface issues that wasn't really mentioned in this design, and I don't think can be mentioned at the moment.

We can discuss if we should add those requirements now (if Redfish schema releases soon) or add them later (if Redfish schema release is not in near term)."

These applications are all related to a very specific feature related to liquid cooling.\n\n> For entity-manager, there is also FruDevice inside that repo and i'm not aware it has caused any issues.\n\n> dbus-sensors has lots of common code related to thresholds and configuration parsing for sensors.
