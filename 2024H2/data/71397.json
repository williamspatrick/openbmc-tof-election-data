(OEM extensions, debug APIs, Redfish, etc).\n\nThese are two different things that we accidentally combine quite often and quite easily.  Yocto differentiates between them with the \"machine\" and \"distro\" concepts.\n\nI think as a matter of this policy, we need to be very clear about the difference, and the policies for each.  I suspect that hardware-specific-features, we could document a policy of \"Don't break other people unnecessarily\" and we'd be pretty close.\n\nIn terms of vendor-specific features, many of which apply to more than one system, we need to come up with a policy that doesn't tie those things to a specific platform, and abstracts them in a way similar to yocto."
