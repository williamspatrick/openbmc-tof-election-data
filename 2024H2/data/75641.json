This design/daemon is concentrating on enabling BMC to be able to communicate with SMCs that specifically can only talks Redfish, and has no intention for solving the broader challenge of REST/HTTPs/Redfish communication.\n2. Single point of failure also means single point of optimization/fix and no duplicated code, which is a reasonable tradeoff in this case as failure to communicating with SMCs is not something completely unacceptable.\n3. The client and server are still going to be communicate via Redfish directly, the type-safe classes are just client implementation detail of how to process response and construct request regarding Redfish protocol. It is a common and good practice to wrap complex raw json objects with classes, and the codegen lib will save engineer time for manually writing those classes. In terms of flexibility, even though I don't believe that's a must-have or high priority feature, the lib itself should have enough room for making change and improvement.\n4. The proposal daemon will definitely use some HTTP libraries that can provide\nindustry standard security feature and may apply SMC specific authentication and\nauthorization methods if any. The reason that security is being mentioned in the design is purely a comparison to \"redfish aggregation\", which exposing the SMC\ndirectly onto the external network. HTTP layer security won't solve this problem as we would like the SMC to be completely invisible to external other than the BMC."

Unclear how that scales in this design.\n\nThis looks like it got marked done without really answering the overall question (which I had the same question below).  This design is proposing we do redfish parsing in more than one repository, whereas previously there was only one (bmcweb).  How do we make sure we're not duplicating a lot of code between them, and thereby requiring all redfish features be added twice, once to the aggregator and once to this client?\n\n> Single point of failure\n\nNot sure I agree the tradeoff is reasonable, and single point of failure implies that we can't create new applications with shared code, rather than rewriting.  Please reword.  FWIW, the reason this wasn't rolled out into its own application for redfish aggregation is so that connections could be persistent, queued, and shared, so as not to overwhelm the Redfish server.  There's certainly a tradeoff here to discuss, but it needs discussed in the background section.\n\n> common and good practice\n\nIs there any other Redfish client that's done this?  As someone who has tried and failed several times, I wasn't aware of any that are used at any kind of scale.  Others have tried (links below) and ended up having to fall back to normal HTTP.  I thought even the guys doing grpc rack manager had fallen back to passing around raw json objects and binary blobs because of the inconsistencies in the Redfish type system.\n\nAs much as I really want to see this succeed, I'm worried we're going to solve 80% of the problem, then not have the ability to solve the last 20%\nto make a complete solution.\n\nhttps://github.com/Nordix/go-redfish\nhttps://gbmc.googlesource.com/gbmcweb/+/refs/heads/master"

If there is a bug in the library that causes failure, every single caller using this library will hit the same failure, not a big difference than having a single service. If the failure root cause is not in the common code path but feature dependent code path, then the failure of one feature should not affect the others if we are able to properly isolate them within the service. At the extreme cases we can always span one process per feature/task to achieve the complete isolation.\n\n> By replacing the DBus calls to the Redfish client service with HTTP library calls, any service can directly communicate with external SMCs\n\nSome BMC services may not do DBus call but wait for Dbus signal and act upon, so they do not directly communicate with external SMCs. They rely on some other daemon or service to talk to the SMCs and emit the dbus signal it's expected. This is one of the main purpose of this design is to provide such service/daemon.\n\nIn terms of HTTP library, I am actually happy to adopt it within the daemon once it is being merged upstream and have good enough feature parity."

DMTF - As the publish new schemas and develop new features.  Some of these are unavailable for 6 months after merge, how is that handled if schemas are static?\n2. Implementations of Redfish that are under development, and might not have complete schemas, as well as implementations of Redfish that are not OpenBMC.\n3. OpenBMC as a whole, which has a lot of the component pieces for this already built and proven, and has OEM schemas that already exist and have history (are those supported?).\n4. Implementations of HTTP/JSON/core libraries that will be extended with new features over time.\n\nThere are lots of unanswered questions surrounding those things in this design, and the wording (maybe unintentional) makes it sound like this effort is just going to rewrite everything because DMTF/Curl/Beast/Nlohmann/bmcweb http_client don't work, but fails to specify why.  If that's not the intent, lets get that written down what core components we plan on using.\n\nOverall, I think the right path here is to start implementing the redfish->struct conversion in a gerrit review (ideally starting with the DMTF one as a base), and lets look at the generated code to see if it's something that will work.  Ideally please start with an old redfish schema, and show that new redfish schemas can be parsed without re-compiling the library against the new schemas (for at least the properties that existed at the time).  As much as I dislike it, this is a requirement that the Redfish standard places on client implementations.\n\nThe other elephant in the room is that the implementation here needs to be capable of supporting schemas that aren't published, or are only published on the systems that produce them, and duplicating those schemas to OpenBMC would violate copyrights (ie, Redfish supports more than just OpenBMC).  FWIW, I think this somewhat necessitates moving away from a compile time struct generation, and more toward Redpath, which in DTMF is intended to be the solution to this exact problem, but wasn't really mentioned in the background.  If Redpath doesn't work for this use case, ideally some feedback to DMTF is in order."

This work is tedious, time consuming because there are roughly 2000+ unique class/typedef/enum/struct needed to written and in average 7 properties for each of those based on the latest redfish schema. Therefore, it would be much more efficient to write a lightweight codegen library that can take redfish schemas and turns into such data classes with static metadata (like which version is the property added/deprecated) filled in and correct dependency graph. In addition, whenever there is new version of redfish schema being published, we can just use the tool to target new set of schemas to generate class rather than having human being to figure out what change and change accordingly."

Value is filled in with the wrong type (this would be a bad implementation of redfish, but happens in practice).\n4. Value is not present.\n5. Value parent key is not present.\n6.

Have we compared to the DMTF one?\n\nhttps://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Schema-C-Struct-Generator\n\nThere's lots of design questions on how this is going to work.  For example, how do you handle things that are not specified with in the schema but are in the protocol spec?  How are error codes responses handled?  How are odata identifiers (that don't show up in schema) handled?  How are features like expand (that I know was called out later in this design doc) handled when the types of a NavigationReference can potentially change the result?\n\nI agree, the idea of type safe classes certainly has a lot of appeal, but the fact that not all Redfish information is available in the schema causes some hard-to-solve corner cases.  If you're interested in my attempt, here is the last time I tried to create type safe redfish to grpc (similar problem space). https://github.com/edtanous/redfish_to_grpc\n\nThat ultimately failed because of the number of corner cases in Redfish.  I'm very worried that we're going to get the easy stuff implemented (read a sensor on an existing schema version), then this daemon won't be able to actually function, or will break with every new redfish revision.  Some code examples that this can even be done correctly would be appreciated so we can look at specific requirements.\n\nFWIW, These problems are why redfish created the Redpath specification: https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0285_1.0.1.pdf\n\nWe should consider including that in the design, as it solves the problem you're trying to solve in a much more targeted way without creating dependencies on specific versions of schema"
