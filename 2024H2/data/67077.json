It leads to this doc which is VERY abstract in its application on how this applies.  It makes some mention that this will be applied to bmcweb, but as the bmcweb maintainer, I really don't think i understand how this is going to help.\n\nit's also really not clear how it relates to: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/63609 if at all, which shows that these kinds of approaches lead to corner cases or code breakages.\n\nOverall, i would not be in support of giving a repository, but I don't think that's required to start this coding project.  Just pick a repository, make a folder where your library code will go, and show how this design can give less complexity and overall code.  Once we have some examples of this being done, it's a lot easier to look at concretely rolling this out.\n\nYou'll note that in the history, we have plenty of examples of large changes (python -> c++ for example) that had no design doc, but were executed one at a time, by iterating and making the code better, faster, and less buggy.  I suspect that's the right approach here."

The design is assumed to target simple single-threaded asynchronous applications.\n\nThis implementation is intended as a reference to address the current limitations in sdbusplus. I hope these issues will be resolved in future updates to sdbusplus."

If an application using the HTTP library wants to leverage senders/receivers, it can do so independently, as you've already mentioned it's possible.\n\nI don't see any strong justification for using senders/receivers in the development of the HTTP library. However, if you believe using them would make the APIs easier to use, I'm okay with it. Personally, I find that senders/receivers introduce a steep learning curve for developers. My main proposal is to design an HTTP library that fits well within the OpenBMC ecosystem."
