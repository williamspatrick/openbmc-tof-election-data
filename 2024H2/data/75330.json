Yes, it doesn't hurt users of `/var/google`. It does however create an invisible dependency on the overlay of the SPI and RWFS. This is going to be worked on shortly, and as far as I know the only other user of shipping underlying mutable files is the rsyslog config. I was going to tackle that one to get it out of the way.\n\nMy suggestion is pretty trivial to implement, although it does take one more point of touch (and yes, you do need that 3rd directory for the image defined keys). If all you want is a symlink in the state dir, just use `tmpfiles.d` and add a one line rule to populate the link.\n`/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/google-bios-key.conf`\n```\nC+ /var/google/bios-key - - - - /usr/share/google-bios-key-ro\n```\nThen you just install these keys into `${datadir}/google-bios-key-ro` and keep your symlink from `${datadir}/google-bios-key -> /var/google/bios-key`\n\nIt's not just a guideline, it's going to get broken. Nearly all other applications on the BMC abide by this practice already.\n\nAlso, localstatedir is `/var/lib`, so `${localstatedir}/google` is not `/var/google`"
