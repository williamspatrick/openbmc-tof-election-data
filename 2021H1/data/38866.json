    "commitMessage": "entity-manager: scan after ObjectManager signals\n\nTrigger a rescan whenever interfaces are added or removed, since they\nmight result in a probe event.\n\nThe schema of ObjectManager signals does not allow us to match the\nspecific interfaces in our probes so we are stuck subscribing to all\nevents from all services.  Rescans could be avoided however, with a\ncustom signal handler with wrapper logic that discards wakeups without a\nrescan if the interfaces added (or removed) are not in our list of probe\ninterfaces.\n\nChange-Id: I834db793ebe05305248a02cb04b601ff0cc6a1ff\nSigned-off-by: Brad Bishop <bradleyb@fuzziesquirrel.com>\n",

In a perfect world (where software is easy) we'd be able to have a many to many mapping of Probes to match expressions, so we'd only ever have to rescan the effected probes when a given interface was added/removed/updated.  With that said, that seems like inglorious overkill, and I'm betting something simpler would likely do just as well.\n\n> \n> Another concern I have is the 5 second delay timer here:\n> \n> https://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/blob/master/src/EntityManager.cpp#L1687\n> \n> did I skim the code too quickly or does this mean the scan will never occur as long as something wakes it up every...4.5 seconds?\n\nI believe that's the case today, although that could certainly be improved."
