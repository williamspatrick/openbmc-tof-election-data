    "commitMessage": "Modify entityPrivileges for certificate service\n\nDMTF published new entity privileges for certificate service classes\nwhich modify entity privilege Certificate, CertificateCollection,\nCertificateLocations, and CertificateService on bmcweb. Modification\nrestricts a user without \"ConfigureManager\" from accessing the\nCertificateCollection and Certificate scehamas\n\nRedfish is a hypermedia API where the parent URI describes sub-URI.\nThus, restricting sub-URI in a parent-URI data helps to forbidden user\naccess, stricken the rule.  So sub-URI only gets display if a user has\naccess to that URI.\n\nRestricting the link allows the Redfish Validator to pass.\n\nThese impact roles without ConfigureManager, which include operator\nand read-only. No access is not impacted since it already did not\nhave access.\n\nThe following are bmcweb user consequences:\n1. ReadOnly and Operator role users are no longer able to view\n   certificates or the certificate collection (LDAP, HTTPS, TrustStore)\n2. Operator role users are no longer able to replace the certificates\n   (LDAP, HTTPS, TrustStore), Install certificates (LDAP, HTTPS,\n   TrustStore) or delete the Truststore Certificate. HTTPS and LDAP\n   certificates do not have delete methods.\n\nResolves openbmc/bmcweb#61\n\nTested: manually tested on Witherspoon system and run Redfish-Service-\nValidator with all roles root, operator, read-only, and No access. Test\npass for root, operator, and read-only roles, And new errors get\nintroduced for no access role.\n\nSigned-off-by: Abhishek Patel <Abhishek.Patel@ibm.com>\nChange-Id: Ibc5eed7db7e224e46f8572df8bcfba2a1ff47644\n",

Can we send something to the mailing list?\n\nI don't know of many openbmc users using the operator role and restricting an API to higher permission users doesn't feel like a break to me. \n\nWith the current 43939, we still have this problem (we differ from the Redfish permissions). \nThe Redfish permissions make sense. An operator shouldn't be allowed to replace a certificate.  (theoretically) Could an operator use replacing the certificate to do a permission escalation attack?\n\nI vote we fix this and other places that differ from the Redfish permissions (if we differ for a good reason, I am okay with keeping that but the ones I have found just feel like mistakes)."

Can we send something to the mailing list?\n\nI think it depends heavily on the impact, which I don't really see a statement of.  Technically the only change in behavior would be for Operator level users, and if we can verify that there's no way you could've had a real impact to working code, I'm ok with this change not having a flag.  If there's a possibility there's an impact to working code, I might still be ok with it, but I want to at least have an understanding documented so that when and if the bug comes in, we'll have something to point to for why we did this.\n\n> \n> I don't know of many openbmc users using the operator role and restricting an API to higher permission users doesn't feel like a break to me. \n\nThey're out there, and there are definitely people testing this stuff;  I'm a little surprised we didn't get this bug filed earlier, but I guess anyone coding against the standard wouldn't have noticed it.\n\n> \n> With the current 43939, we still have this problem (we differ from the Redfish permissions). \n> The Redfish permissions make sense. An operator shouldn't be allowed to replace a certificate.  (theoretically) Could an operator use replacing the certificate to do a permission escalation attack?\n\nnot sure.\n\n> \n> I vote we fix this and other places that differ from the Redfish permissions (if we differ for a good reason, I am okay with keeping that but the ones I have found just feel like mistakes).\n\nI'm ok with that, but lets make sure we:\n1. Have a permanent solution so we don't keep hitting this.  (I think my privileges commit is this)\n2. have documented the impact when we change things that might have user facing consequences."
