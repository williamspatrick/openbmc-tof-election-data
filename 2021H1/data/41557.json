    "commitMessage": "psu-ng: Created map of supported PS configurations\n\nThe supported configutation entity manager object provides at a minimum\nthe supported type and model for the system. Check for \"PowerSupply\"\ntype, and PSU model. Then store the rest of the properties if present\nsuch as max count and input voltage.\n\nReplace MaxCount with RedundantCount since that's the property to be\nused with power supplies.\nUse a multimap since there may be mutiple supported configurations for\nthe same model, example, the system could support 2 PSU model 51E9 with\ninput voltage 220, or 4 PSU of the same model 51E9 with input voltage\n110. The multimap would then look like:\n51E9: 2, 220\n51E9: 4, 110\n\nThe monitor app can then read the PSU model that's present, and search\nfor all the supported combinations that the system supports for that\nmodel.\n\nTested: Verified that multiple supported configuration objects in\n        Rainier populated the multimap as expected.\n\nChange-Id: I44283f56f9e5defb37f42c5149cec63d902efd76\nSigned-off-by: Adriana Kobylak <anoo@us.ibm.com>\n",
