    "commitMessage": "Fix early exit for non D-Bus probes\n\nThe existing code had a bug where it would require a D-Bus interface to\nbe present for a probe in order to continue on to create any\nconfiguration objects.  This doesn't always work because some probe\nstatements, like \"TRUE\", don't need any D-bus interface checks to\nsucceed.\n\nThe fix is to continue on, and just pass an empty map of D-Bus\ninterfaces into the template substitution function.\n\nThis bug was introduced in my 'Do tmpl substitutions using all\nproperties on path\" commit.\n\nTested:\nTested with a Probe: \"TRUE\" config and saw the configuration object for\nit created on D-Bus.\n\nSigned-off-by: Matt Spinler <spinler@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I672a5fe055801d8bd674778350ce8f434cc0c430\n",
