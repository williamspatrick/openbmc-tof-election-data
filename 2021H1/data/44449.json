    "commitMessage": "Restructure Redfish EventLog Transmit code flow\n\nIn the current implementation:\n 1. When Event service is disabled and enabled back after a while,\n    all the logs during this time span between disable to enable\n    are dumped to the Event listener.\n 2. When two(or more) events occur very close (in terms of\n    microseconds) and they trigger multiple iNotify events,\n    the listener receives all of these events with the same\n    Event ID.\n\nThis occurs as the last log timestamp read from redfish file\nand previous time stamp used to generate Event ID's are not\nbeing updated continuously.\n\nThis commit fixes this issue by tweaking the logic to continuously\nupdate the time stamp values (even when Event Service is disabled),\nand also replaces multiple string operations with file operations.\ni.e. Instead of looping through the entire Redfish file until last\ntimestamp read is reached, this fix makes use of seekg to get to\nthe last read position.\n\nTested:\n  - Subscribed to an event and successfully received Event Logs.\n  - No Event Logs were received when Event Service was disabled.\n  - No Dump of past Events after Event Service was enabled.\n  - Redfish Validator passed\n\nChange-Id: Id8407ff7e9fc48e7810c9193ef43f707b9615c36\nSigned-off-by: P Dheeraj Srujan Kumar <p.dheeraj.srujan.kumar@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Ankita Vilas Gawade <ankita.gawade@intel.com>\n",
