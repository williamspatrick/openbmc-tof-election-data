    "commitMessage": "Do tmpl substitutions using all properties on path\n\nThe current code would substitute the template arguments in the JSON\nfiles, such as $bus, by only looking at the properties of the interface\nthat passed the probe.\n\nThis commit will try to find a substitution using the properties of all\nof the interfaces on the same object path as the interface that passed\nthe probe.  It does this by reading and storing the properties of all\ninterfaces that came back from the existing GetSubTree call that finds\nthe paths of the probed interfaces, instead of just limiting it to the\ninterfaces that were probed.  The template substitutions are then tried\non the properties of all interfaces until one is successful.\n\nThis change is being made so that the interface used in the probe\ndoesn't also need to contain properties for the device details, such as\nthe bus property, that otherwise wouldn't belong there.  For example,\nthe com.ibm.ipzvpd.VINI interface, which models EEPROM contents, is\ncurrently used in probes on IBM systems, and with this change the bus\nand address properties can now be on a separate interface, such as the\nrecently proposed xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Decorator.I2CDevice.\n\nTested:  Tested that the $bus template can be successfully filled in\nwith the Bus property from an interface other than the one the probe was\nmatched on.\n\nSigned-off-by: Matt Spinler <spinler@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: Ic6f1539b38f6a4098f131d7f14cad6b6ddff041f\n",
