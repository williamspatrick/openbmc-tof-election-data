If you're interested in privilege isolation, you should be reviewing and testing the patches @mouse is pushing currently.  In the context of this patch, which is fixing a bug, I'm not sure what changes you're asking for.\n\nI'm still of the opinion that we need to sort out the development of the virtual media backend, and it's merge with the existing one before any of these patches go through."
