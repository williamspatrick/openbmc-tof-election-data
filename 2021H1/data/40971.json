If the\nentity manager interface does not exist by the time the psu manager\nstarts, subscribe to interfaces added. The psu manager can take action\nonce the max count property is available on D-Bus.\n\nTested: On Rainier 2U with debug traces:\n1. Restarted phosphor-psu-monitor and verified maxPowerSupplies was 2.\n2. Stopped xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Manager. Restarted\n   phosphor-psu-monitor and verified maxPowerSupplies was 0.\n3. Started xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Manager and verified the\n   psu callback was triggered setting maxPowerSupplies to 2.\n4. Stopped and started xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Manager and\n   verified the psu callback was not called again.\n\nChange-Id: Ieff796ca5c79bfddc1fc6e15e339a0b15eb422d7\nSigned-off-by: Adriana Kobylak <anoo@us.ibm.com>\n",

I'll have to check with Derek what should happen in case entity manager is not ready. It's my understanding that the psu-monitor app should not prevent the power on, so it may be that once it has the information, even if power on already started, it takes action at that moment."

For example, you are registering to get all interfacesAdded signals from EntityManager.  Some of those signals are for different interfaces than the one you are looking for, and those interfaces have properties whose values are not of type uint64_t.  I'm not sure what the sdbusplus wrapper does if we specify std::variant<uint64_t>> and the actual property type is vector<string>."
