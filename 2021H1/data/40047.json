If it's analogous to an IPMI discrete sensor, then your path forward would be to add Resources where you need them to log this type of event.\n\n> How about changing it as only `StateSensorStateChange`? Basically it will give a info saying that the state of the sensor is changed from one value to another.\n\nI think you're somewhat missing the point.  Redfish has a well defined way to model resources, and this someone brings the abstraction back to IPMI , which we should avoid."
