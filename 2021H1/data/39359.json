    "commitMessage": "host state transitioning support\n\nThe following commit has some relevant background:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/commit/9f65dfeaa5ab22cae03db45c9916868da9864f83\n\nThe new services introduced in this commit will set these new transition\nstates. They will work together with the existing state-manager\ninfrastructure in that the new services will set the transitions when\nthe targets start and the current software which looks for the targets\nto complete will update the state to the official Running/Off.\n\nBut why not just have the existing software that monitors for the\ntargets to complete also monitor for them to start? This was a long and\ndark hole I went down for a while. In the end, systemd D-Bus signals do\nnot provide enough information on target starts. The signals let you\nknow that \"something\" is going to happen to the target you're interested\nin, but not the details. For example, if you start the\nobmc-host-start@.target, you get two systemd notifications that indicate\n\"something\" is going to happen to obmc-host-start@.target and also that\n\"something\" is going to happen to obmc-host-stop@.target. This is\nbecause when one target starts, it stops the other. Since they are both\njust queued for \"something\" there's no mechanism to interrogate them for\nwhich one is doing what. I tried a lot of different things here but\njust couldn't get anything that covered all paths. The maintainers of\nsystemd have indicated on their mailing list that they are not\ninterested in enhancing the signal data because they feel like it would\nbe a rat hole of never ending data getting added to it.\n\nTested:\n- Built into an image and verified CurrentHostState changed as expected\n  doing a host on, off, and reboot.\n\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Geissler <geissonator@yahoo.com>\nChange-Id: Id2e9bd0394fc71944d26ce4bd40b136acf82b5e4\n",
