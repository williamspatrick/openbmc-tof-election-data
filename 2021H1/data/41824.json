    "commitMessage": "regulators: Wait for compatible system types\n\nThere are two options for naming the JSON configuration file:\n1. Default name\n2. Name based on compatible system types provided by EntityManager\n\nIf option #2 is used, there is no guarantee that EntityManager will have\npublished the compatible systems types on D-Bus before a boot is\nattempted.  This is not common, but the problem has occurred.\n\nWhen the boot begins, the regulators application configures the voltage\nregulators.  If the config file has not been found and loaded, this\nconfiguration cannot occur.\n\nThis commit enhances the regulators application to wait for\nEntityManager to publish the compatible systems information during the\nboot so that the regulators can be configured.\n\nA maximum wait time is enforced to prevent the boot from being blocked\nindefinitely.  If this maximum wait time is reached, a critical error is\nlogged indicating that the voltage regulators could not be configured.\n\nTested:\n* System types available before boot\n* Have to wait for system types during boot\n  * System types found within 5 minutes\n  * System types not found within 5 minutes\n* For complete test plan details, see\n  https://gist.github.com/smccarney/b059a5f4da1a9138af770217cbafaea3\n\nSigned-off-by: Shawn McCarney <shawnmm@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I700a376b94603f36defd1fe266c0a2d7e2a9d30b\n",

                    "message": "> Can the regulators be configured during the boot?\n\nThe regulators need to be configured before they are powered on by the power sequencer.  That occurs very early in the boot.  Otherwise, if the default regulator settings (like output voltage) are significantly wrong, hardware damage could occur.  Also, some regulators don't allow certain configuration changes to be made after being powered on.\n\n> Sounds like we won't prevent the boot from happening (instead an error is logged)\n\nThe requirement is actually to stop the boot if the app cannot configure the regulators.  The error logged has a special severity that will cause the boot to stop.\n\n> Also if there are no compatible system types for that system, we'd be blocking the boot for 5 min every time.\n\nThe regulators application is optional, so an OpenBMC system builder needs to \"opt into\" it.  When using the regulators app, there are two options for finding the JSON config file:\n* Use the default file name\n* Get file name based on EM info\n\nThe 5 minute wait will only occur in the following scenario:\n* Default file name not found, and\n* No compatible system types info found on D-Bus"

I'm not sure, however, exactly how long I waited.  It was probably in the 2-4 minute range.\n\nIf you do `obmcutil -w chassison`, obmcutil returns after about 30 seconds stating it couldn't tell if the boot succeeded.  But later, when the boot completes, `obmcutil state` will show that the chassis is powered on.\n\nThe regulators application starts running at BMC Ready and stays running whether the system is powered on or off.  During the boot, a tool called regsctl does a D-Bus method call on the regulators application to request that the regulators be configured.  I found that by default, this method call timed out after 20 or 30 seconds.  That is why I had to change the utility.hpp file used by regsctl and specify a 6 minute timeout."

I was trying to balance two competing concerns:\n* Wanting to get the boot moving ASAP\n* Not hammering D-Bus and the mapper with what is essentially polling for the EM data\n\nIf you think 5 secs is a better balance point, I'll change it.\n\nIn case you are curious, I did look into trying to do this in a way that utilizes the interfacesAdded callback to avoid the \"polling\".  However, it is tricky in this situation.  We cannot call eventLoop.run() to run the event loop once because we are in the wrong event loop state.  If we leave this method, we will have to return something to the client.  I could return something special to the client (regsctl) and have it loop instead.  In that case, we are replacing object manager polling with regulators app polling.  So I just left it as is for now."
