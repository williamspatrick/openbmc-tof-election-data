In our system, it's not really needed because the PSU fans are controlled by the PSU itself instead of the BMC.\n\nThis is true on all systems I'm aware of.  Generally the BMC is able to increase the PSU fan speed, to avoid weird pressure pockets within the case.  I'd double check with your thermal designers to make sure that's not required on your system, but if it's not, simply removing it seems like a good option.\n\n> We probably do need to remove the pwm sensor in such case."
