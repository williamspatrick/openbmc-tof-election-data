Given you've stated that you weren't thinking out loud, something more direct would have helped.\n\nAnyway, I understand arrays as a concept. I'm still learning meson, so the request for a PoC was to help me make changes there with fewer iterations of you not liking whatever it was I cooked up.

I'll try to keep yours direct.\n\n> I'm still learning meson, so the request for a PoC was to help me make changes there with fewer iterations of you not liking whatever it was I cooked up.\n\nThat was similarly not obvious.  It came across to me more that you were blowing me off with a 'patches welcome'.  I honestly review 100-300 commits a month around here.  If I had to provide the 'fixes' for every review comment of mine I'd really get nothing else done.\n\nAnyhow, this is a fairly common / accepted pattern in meson and I don't think requires much change to your current meson.build.\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/debug-trigger/blob/master/meson.build#L23\nhttps://mesonbuild.com/Build-options.html#arrays <-- also see 'array_opt' in examples at top of the page.\nhttps://mesonbuild.com/Reference-manual.html#array-object <-- arrays can use .contains or python-like 'foo in array' syntax.\n\nArrays are passed to meson as a comma-separated list (like I gave in the original example) or you can optionally wrap them in a [] for \"clarity\".\n\n> fewer iterations of you not liking whatever it was I cooked up\n\nMy only requirement is that there is at most one PACKAGECONFIG for the debug triggers.  I don't think we should have to add a new PACKAGECONFIG for each and every way that we can trigger the debug, and looking at your meson.build / meson_options this seems problematic to maintain there as well.
