    "commitMessage": "regulators: Enable sensor monitoring\n\nEnable sensor monitoring in the phosphor-regulators application.\n\nPrevious commits implemented the majority of the sensor monitoring\nsupport.  This commit contains the last set of changes needed to enable\nmonitoring for the entire application.\n\nModify the top level Manager class to enable or disable monitoring based\non the D-Bus 'monitor' method.  This method is called by the regsctl\ncommand line tool.  Service files use regsctl to enable monitoring\nduring power on and disable monitoring during power off.\n\nWhen monitoring is enabled, set a repeating, one-second timer.  When the\ntimer expires, execute one sensor monitoring cycle for all voltage\nregulator sensors.\n\nWhen monitoring is disabled, turn off the timer.  Put all the sensors in\nan inactive state, indicating they are no longer being updated.  They\nwill remain in this state until the system is powered on again.\n\nTested:\n* Verified sensor monitoring is enabled when chassis is powered on.\n* Verified sensor monitoring is disabled when chassis is powered off.\n* Verified voltage regulator sensors are read once per second while\n  monitoring is enabled.\n* Verified sensors are published on D-Bus when monitoring is enabled.\n* Verified sensors remain on D-Bus but are put in an inactive state when\n  monitoring is disabled.\n* Verified sensors are not read when monitoring is disabled.\n* Tested where D-Bus queries to obtain current power state fail with a\n  D-Bus exception.\n* Verified sensor monitoring is enabled if BMC is reset while chassis is\n  powered on.\n* Verified sensor monitoring is enabled if regulators application is\n  stopped and re-started while chassis is powered on.\n* For complete test plan, see\n  https://gist.github.com/smccarney/0afa4a50afcf9f0d47e1a21ebe33dbfc\n\nSigned-off-by: Shawn McCarney <shawnmm@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: Ic85d4baa0a53e57bd2a494611d70a76ae7b135f7\n",

The sensors from the previous config file would get removed from D-Bus."
