    "commitMessage": "Fan: Optimize the pwm sensor creation\n\nGiven fan*_input and its corresponding pwm* hwmon sys files are always\nunder the same diretory, we should use that directory to generate the\npwm sensor rather than deduce it from scratch. This also fixes all\nkind of issues that come into play when multiple fan hwmon controllers\nexisit on the system.\n\nTested: the tach and pwm sensors continue to be the same as before.\n\nChange-Id: I54a4059e47190cb9f66e9e11a9f9a373ebf0fc16\nSigned-off-by: Yong Zhao <yozhao@google.com>\n",

Supposing they were separate, it means we need a lot more info than just the number in the sys file names to know the association between tachs and pwms."

Given that defect of the current code, what's the next step? Fix that defect before this change or after? If before, the design is not clear to me. If it is clear, I could help to carry out the implementation."
