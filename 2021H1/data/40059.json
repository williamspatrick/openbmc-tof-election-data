If a system supports both type 1 and type 2 then the code will need to understand that and return the appropriate response (i.e not allowed on hypervisors that don't support it). All machines will support the BootProgress so tracking the state of the hypervisor should work in all cases.

So looks like, by \"default\", the behavior for this State will be completely unchanged for say OPAL, but if PowerVM wants to implement ways to read and set the state, they could.\n \n> > And what happens when we haven't yet reached a state where any hypervisor or OS is running yet?

I guess this reinforces that for OPAL mode, nothing changes. If Linux (or RHEV-H or Xen..) wants to use that they can, but the Host states would follow that of a Bare-Metal OS if they dont."
