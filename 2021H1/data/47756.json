    "commitMessage": "State: Decorator: Added the Status interface\n\n- The Redfish Status property is common for all the Redfish schema\n  and that is used to indicate the status of the particular resource\n  instance.\n\n- The intention of this new interface is, replicate the Redfish\n  Status.State property so that the D-Bus service implementer can use\n  this interface if they want to share the state of the object\n  (which are managed by that service) through the Redfish interface.\n\n- Today, the Redfish service provider and the D-Bus service implementer\n  using different interfaces (which are mentioned below) to map with\n  Status.State but, those interfaces property is boolean so we can't\n  use more states which are defined in the Redfish and that demands\n  to introduce new interfaces to use the defined Status.State\n  enumerations if something needs to use in the OpenBMC project.\n\n  - Currently, the below interfaces are used for the Redfish\n    Status.State\n    - xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item::Present\n      - If true then setting as \"Enabled\" else \"Absent\" but, we can't\n        assume as \"If present then, it is enabled\" because it might\n        present but, not functional due to some other reason so the\n        state \"Enabled\" might be inaccurate.\n    - xyz.openbmc_project.State.Decorator.Availability::Available\n      - This interface was intended for the Status.State\n        \"UnavailableOffline\" enumeration but, it is not used for that\n        purpose in the OpenBMC project. Refer \"e5ccf3a\" commit.\n\n- Even if we are introducing new interfaces for each state then,\n  the maintainability will be difficult for both (Redfish and\n  D-Bus) service provider to make consistent value.\n\n- So, we can have one interface that can contain a list of enumerations\n  to indicate the state of the object instead of defining new\n  interfaces so added the new interface for the same in this patch.\n\n- More details about the Redfish Status.State can be found\n  in the \"DSP2046_2021.2.pdf\" section 4.15.\n  (https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP2046_2021.2.pdf)\n\nSigned-off-by: Ramesh Iyyar <rameshi1@in.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I601340df2a44e2e14f33eb8bc459c7d58e5cb215\n",

It may have to pull out information from multiple interfaces, associations, etc. \n\nCan you point me to the existing interfaces that you are mentioning here for the defined properties? One of the goals we are trying to discuss with this interface is a single interface vs multiple interfaces to form the Redfish Condition. Any opinion?\n\nand also having an association will demand more dbus calls for each inventory item object to get all required properties (from that associated object) to form the Redfish Status.Condition if the redfish client triggered GET request, right? is it fine?\n\nFor example, 2 * N (1 - Use mapper to get service name, 1 - Use GetManagedObjects to get all properties, N - No of particular inventory item objects)\n\nHi @Gunnar,\n\n> Can conditions be a separate commit?\n\nYes, I can push as a separate commit, I will split this commit for further discussion."

Looks, we are discussing where the Redfish Status properties D-Bus mapping should go."

This is to make it easier to port to new APIs in the future, for example, Redfish didn't exist when the dbus interfaces were first created, yet we were able to add them with relatively few interface-level changes (mostly additions).  This change would be a significant departure from that, which I don't think is great, considering that in terms of major protocols, we support PLDM, IPMI, and Redfish today, and duplicating the idea of a \"status\" between all three of them would be very wasteful."

This commit also \"introduce new interfaces\", without deprecating or removing the old ones, so I'm not really following why this patchset is better.  If this were consolidating and removing/deprecating the old status APIs and consolidating them (along with patchsets to update the relevant daemons), i think I could support it more, but as writte, it's just yet another interface, without clear rules on when to use the existing interfaces, and when to use this interface."
