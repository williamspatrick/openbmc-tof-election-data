    "commitMessage": "RFC: implement clang-format/tidy as a bbclass\n\nThis commit allows developers to run the openbmc static analysis as part\nof their \"normal\" build process.\n\nRight now this is limited to meson-enabled projects, and implements a\nbbclass that other recipes can inherit from for projects that support\nthe unit testing procedures.\n\nThis would allow running CI tools through bitbake, which has some pretty\ncompelling advantages:\n1. Clang tooling would be updated using the same process we use for\nevery other meta layer, giving us more flexibility to keep more up to\ndate with clang.\n2. The tests for almost all openbmc project could be run as part of the\n\"normal\" build, so changes that are incremental, or only might effect\none or two projects can be handled just like we would if an upstream\nproject breaks us.\n\nTODO:\nThis should really be protected behind a local.conf variable that\ndefaults to OFF so not everyone is taking a build-time hit every time.\nThis requires meta-clang to be subtree added and checked out in\nopenbmc/openbmc and added to the bblayers.conf\n\nThis is deep in the WIP category, and has only had initial touch\ntesting, which seems to be straightforward.\n\nRequires https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/46506 to\nbe useful.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: I303c6a90bcfb3e5e301db2bb9223ad5b85c25689\n",
