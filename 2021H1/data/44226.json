In the new\ndesign there is no need to store such properties twice,\n- by default make override feature disabled and permanent.\n\nSigned-off-by: Konstantin Aladyshev <aladyshev22@gmail.com>\nChange-Id: Ie59ba703a6f39f8e1d4934cce89cbe8cd5a826e4\n",

You can change them via BIOS menu.\n- Also BIOS at boot asks via IPMI the BMC controller if it has enabled (=valid in IPMI terminology) boot source override. If it has, BIOS uses settings from BMC. If it hasn't, BIOS uses its own NVRAM settings.\n- If BMC override is enabled, BIOS checks if \"one-time\" setting is enabled. If it is, BIOS clears \"boot override valid\" flag in BMC and boots. If it isn't, BIOS doesn't modify settings in BMC.\n\nIn this approach BMC stores only one set of override settings. After the \"one-time\" override BIOS wouldn't use some other BMC settings, but it would fallback to its own NVRAM settings."
