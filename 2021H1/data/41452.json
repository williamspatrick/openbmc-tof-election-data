I still somewhat disagree with why this is done, as to me, it is only adding a layer of obfuscation, as D-Bus directory paths are already something that's visible in the interface, so why not just let the user configure the directory path directly, instead of running it through the mapping table? Maybe validate it to only an allowlist of names, if desired. I still think it would be easier for the user to just have the ability to specify a directory path component directly, like \"temperature\", instead of having to mentally translate it to \"DegreesC\" in their head when writing the configuration file."
