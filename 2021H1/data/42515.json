    "commitMessage": "Change the word TS to Time Stamp & add time unit\n\n - The Message argument in the BIOSPOSTCode Message Entry\n   uses short form wording for TS (Time Stamp) & without any time unit.\n\n - As the Message argument is directly displayed on OpenBMC GUI\n   as it is, word \"TS\" would create customer confusion due to it\n   not being a well known acronym. Also a field like this that\n   captures a physical quantity(time) should have units.\n\n - Redfish clients should not be parsing the message argument, so\n   changing this wording should not break them.\n\n - Also, this commit changes \":\" to \";\" in the Message argument to\n   makes things look consistent.\n\n - As we changed the content of Message in the Message Entry, we had to\n   bump up the minor version of the Message registry.\n\nTested By:\n\n1. Redfish Validator Passed.\n\nSigned-off-by: Manojkiran Eda <manojkiran.eda@gmail.com>\nChange-Id: I17924c2dfdcf34563f8f8cd325011e13cb70e476\n",

For all I care they could be A, B, C, D.  With that said, lets do what Gunnar suggested and what Redfish does.\n\n> > Should we also be bumping the minor version when adding new messages ?

What I found is that log_services.hpp, message_registries::getMessage currently ignores the version fields.  So, it looks like we may be safe to start increasing the registry version number to track new messages without impacting the existing logging.  There is a larger discussion still around when and how to version and how to handle it correctly in log_services.hpp, but for now, we may not be blocked.  As a test, I changed the registry version to 0.2 and my Redfish log continued to work correctly even though my events were logged as 0.1.\n> \n> Sweet.
