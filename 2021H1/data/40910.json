This IPMI information controls how the x86 BIOS launches the operating system, in \"legacy mode\" or \"EFI mode\", which changes how the BIOS data is forwarded on to the OS and if it starts in 16 bit or 32/64 bit modes. \n\nThere are two issues here w.r.t. Power:\n\n1. This bit was never set previously.  I suspect that Hostboot and skiboot/petitboot make no use of it so it wouldn't matter how it is set, but someone from IBM would need to confirm that.\n2. Eventually someone is going to want to make WebUI for this setting.  Are you willing to have this setting show up on a GUI screen even though it has absolutely no affect on your machine?\n\nThe safest thing is to only include this interface in x86 machines and trigger that off a MACHINE_FEATURE.  Ideally it wouldn't even be set here unless the machine really called for it (not just remove in meta-openpower).  But, if IBM is fine with testing out #1 and dealing with #2, it certainly would be simpler to just add it everywhere.\n\n(*) - I don't know of any ARM machine that boots in both \"device tree\" and UEFI mode, but I could be wrong.  I suspect that a vendor would just pick one because there aren't any \"legacy\" OSes that you'd need to deal with."
