    "commitMessage": "Implement a test for patch compliance\n\nPer our documentation, patches outside of a couple specific directories\naren't allowed.  This commit implements a build-time check to see if any\nnew patches have been added.  Functionally, because there's several meta\nlayers that have broken the rules already, it has to contain a check\nagainst the various patches that already exist in the tree.  This list\ndoesn't constitute a grandfather-ing in of those patches, but recognizes\nthat we can't immediately back them out, and having the maintainers take\ncare of them will take time.\n\nOf note, this patchset also ignores patches in any of the poky layers,\nas we can't define their policies, and allows patches in meta-phosphor,\nas a backdoor in case we need a trapdoor to this policy, and all the\nmaintainers agree to it.\n\nTested:\nRan\nexport export target=repotest\n./build-setup.sh\n\nand saw the test passing.  Then amended the filelist by hand to remove\nan entry from the allowlist, and saw the script return -1.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: I1c3e062278b4856cbfda910bdbf122e4b7539f89\n",
