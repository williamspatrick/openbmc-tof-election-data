    "commitMessage": "Configs: Everest: Update led names to reflect pca955x\n\nOriginally, all the leds were driven by \"leds-gpio\" driver.\nHowever, community wanted the leds off PCA955x to be driven by\nleds-pca955x driver. As part of that, all the leds that are\ndriven by pca955x leds driver would have the name prefix pca955x.\nSo, if the name of the led before was \"dimm\", now, it would be\n\"pca955x:dimm\". phosphor-ledcontroller hosts these as\n/xyz/openbmc_project/led/physical/pca955x_dimm as opposed to\n/xyz/openbmc_project/led/physical/dimm.\n\nA patch to have the ability to turn off this prefix was sent\nto the kernel community and it was rejected.\n\nIn the user space, we could have cut the pca955x_ portion and still\nretained the old names. However, that results in some one off code\nand hence not desired.\n\nChange-Id: I198c68898821cae1efb3e6b70ce6c1aece8163c9\nSigned-off-by: Vishwanatha Subbanna <vishwa@linux.vnet.ibm.com>\n",
