    "commitMessage": "sensors: move up the callback for getSensorData\n\nRemove the nested level of callbacks for getSensorData(), since it can\nbe executed earlier in the method call. There is no need to keep passing\nin the callback until the very end when all the required information\nare already available.\n\nThis provided some performance improvement on sensor requests.\n\nTested:\n\nRedfish Validator Passed.\n\nBefore\n```\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/chassis0/Sensors\nINFO - \t Type (#SensorCollection.SensorCollection), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.375195)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/chassis0/Sensors/sensor0\nINFO - \t Type (#Sensor.v1_0_0.Sensor), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.687335)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/chassis0/Sensors/sensor1\nINFO - \t Type (#Sensor.v1_0_0.Sensor), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.653246)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/chassis0/Sensors/sensor2\nINFO - \t Type (#Sensor.v1_0_0.Sensor), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.641425)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n...\n```\n\nAfter 25 sensor read:\n```\nreal    0m16.783s\nuser    0m0.209s\nsys     0m0.194s\n```\n\nAfter:\n```\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/GSZ/Sensors/P0_P12V_DIMM_lin\nINFO - \t Type (#Sensor.v1_0_0.Sensor), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.579379)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/GSZ/Sensors/P1_P12V_DIMM_lin\nINFO - \t Type (#Sensor.v1_0_0.Sensor), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.613467)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/GSZ/Sensors/brick2_p12v_Output_Current\nINFO - \t Type (#Sensor.v1_0_0.Sensor), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.599699)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n```\n\n```\nreal    0m15.830s\nuser    0m0.223s\nsys     0m0.158s\n```\n\nWith https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/47885\n```\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/chassis0/Sensors\nINFO - \t Type (#SensorCollection.SensorCollection), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.365233)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/chassis0/Sensors/sensor0\nINFO - \t Type (#Sensor.v1_0_0.Sensor), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.555482)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/chassis0/Sensors/sensor1\nINFO - \t Type (#Sensor.v1_0_0.Sensor), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.563385)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n*** /redfish/v1/Chassis/chassis0/Sensors/sensor2\nINFO - \t Type (#Sensor.v1_0_0.Sensor), GET SUCCESS (time: 0.605868)\nINFO - \t PASS\nINFO -\n```\n\n```\nreal    0m15.647s\nuser    0m0.259s\nsys     0m0.130s\n```\n\nChange-Id: I58a259c57d1fbdbf75f83f20330c885cfe2ff9e1\nSigned-off-by: Willy Tu <wltu@google.com>\n",

I missed the fact that `inventoryItems` was also updated in those calls.\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/e8204933be90353ef672e62dc628448173279e1c/redfish-core/lib/sensors.hpp#L2230-L2239 \n\nAlso looks like the supply has dependencies on LED in https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/e8204933be90353ef672e62dc628448173279e1c/redfish-core/lib/sensors.hpp#L2464-L2501\n\nAfter looking at it in more details, it seems like the order dependencies are required for it to work.\n\nI'll try to see if there are other ways to refactor it. I was trying to see if we can move the powerSupply to not block getSensorData. Maybe have the powerSupply inject its data into it later, but it does not know where to add the information.\n\nMore time will be needed to resolve this."
