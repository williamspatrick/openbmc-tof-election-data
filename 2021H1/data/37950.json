I don't see any reason to restrict the multi-item update process to \"firmware\" either by calling it \"fw update\".\n\n2. What we're really doing here is extending Activation so that the Activation is applied across a set of Inventory items.  I would suggest instead we create an interface maybe called ActivationItems (Elements?) which has a property : Items type=array<object_path> and maybe a method : AddItem(object_path).  The object_paths will reference the Inventory item to be updated.  When the activation is done the the update code will apply to all the applicable Inventory objects in the Items array.  We may need a signal for failed updates, especially in the case where the update image does not apply to the item.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to see Activation refactored in a way where it can support a direct relationship between the SoftwareVersion and the Inventory item(s) to be updated.  I think there are some cases where you'll want to do an update to all the devices and some cases where you'll want to do the update one at a time but still without deleting the update at the end.  In my mind, the default behavior of the system should be to *not* delete an update for which there still exists an Inventory item that the update *could* apply to, unless the user explicitly Delete's the update."
