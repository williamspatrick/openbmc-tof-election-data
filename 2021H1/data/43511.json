Thus the chosen type. For this application, there should be no cross-platform sharing of this data file, so inter-platform compatibility for the same data file need not be preserved.\n\nWe need to figure out where the actual problem is (what assumption is being made about struct sizes and offsets) and modify the code to handle that."
