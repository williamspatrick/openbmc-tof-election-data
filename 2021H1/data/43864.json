    "commitMessage": "Modify entityPrivileges for certificate service\n\nDMTF published new entity privileges for certificate service classes\nwhich modify all this entity privilege for Certificate,\nCertificateCollection, CertificateLocations, and CertificateService on\nbmcweb. Modification restricts a user from accessing that node and\nrelated information.\n\nRedfish DMTF API  is a chain of URI, where parent URI describes sub-URI.\nThus, restricting sub-URI in a parent-URI data helps to forbidden user\naccess, stricken the rule.  So sub-URI only get display if a user has\naccess to that URI.\n\nRestricting sub-URI helps in Jenkins validation too.\n\nResolves openbmc/bmcweb#61\n\nTested: manually tested on Witherspoon system and run Jenkins\nRedfish-Service-Validator with all roles root, operator, read-only, and\nNo access. test passed and no new errors were introduced\n\nSigned-off-by: Abhishek Patel <Abhishek.Patel@ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I01520096490ffbd0109b0851c6e9860261fd2a1a\n",
