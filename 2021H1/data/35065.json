It will not affect the existing design. No need to update the design.\n2. Code changes is minimal for multi process.\n3. Just need to provide multiple service to launch multiple process in the machine layer based on number of host in chasis.\n4. It will not affect the single host systems. we can use host0 reserved for single host.\n5. x86-power-control,obmc-console already using this multi service apporch.. it would be common for all multi-host applciation.\n \nDisadvantages :\n1.

A big part of the reason why is that you've used the opposite verb.\n\nA method called 'readPostcode' means to me that you are asking the 'Raw' object to do a read.  In this case, you're actually trying to 'POST' a postcode (I've used HTTP terminology).\n\nThe current 'Raw' interface holds a single postcode.  Existing implementations of it receive their value from hardware and they should not get this new method (because we would not want someone to 'post' an additional postcode).  If we really need this method, I think we need a new interface.\n\nHaving said that, I have two alternative proposals:\n\n1. Is there any reason the IPMI daemon cannot host this object and update the 'Raw.Value' on its own?  Why do we need a separate daemon to hold a single integer?\n\n2. Can we make 'Raw.Value' writable in the current implementation?  A compile or config value could be the switch between \"get Raw.Value from hardware\" or \"get Raw.Value from property write operations\"."

(I would actually suggest that writing the GPIOs is the responsibility of entirely different process, unless it already has that behavior, but I'm not the maintainer of that codebase.)\n\n> I understand that 'Raw.Value' already read/write property and will investigate on how to write postcode in to 'Raw.Value' from IPMI daemon(fb-ipmi-oem) using set-property or other method.\n\nOk."
