There will be a new application which captures BMC and Host health information. Here's how it's going to do it, here's how you get the info from this application, ...\n\nA howto guide is more of a \"This is how you get your system working with OpenBMC\" or \"This is how you debug an OpenBMC system\"."

There are lots of whitespace violations, which don't inspire confidence that the author reviewed it before push.\n2. a lot of what this doc is proposing is a design, or is duplicating information that already exists in the docs structure.\n3. This doc proposes implementations that don't comply with the redfish spec, and writes them in a way such that they're a forgone conclusion.  If this were modeled as a \"this is how data flows through the system\", I could see it being a useful how-to guide, but as is, it's a combination of a design proposal and changes to existing designs."
