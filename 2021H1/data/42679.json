    "commitMessage": "Fix \"the system configuration is removed when the host is off\"\n\nThere is one bug in entity-manager which causes the current system\nconfiguration is removed, when the host is off. This bug appears in the entity\nconfiguration which doesn't set PowerState option.\nThis commit adds the fix for that issue.\n\nTested:\n\tA. Test case 1: without option PowerState\n\t1. Add the entity configuration without PowerState.\n\t2. Boot up the BMC with the compiled image. Turn off the host.\n\t3. Verify The added configuration /var/configuration/system.json.\n\n\tB: Test case 2: with option PowerState is \"On\"\n\t1. Add the entity configuration with \"PowerState\":\"On\".\n\t2. Boot up the BMC with the compiled image. Turn off the host.\n\t3. /var/configuration/system.json should be empty.\n\nSigned-off-by: ThuBaNguyen <thu@os.amperecomputing.com>\nChange-Id: Id5f84d88c9f21352b3781a3044a6b573b7792e43\n",
