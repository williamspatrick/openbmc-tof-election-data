    "commitMessage": "PEL: Add critical error for regulators config file\n\nAdd a new message registry entry for a critical error involving the\nphosphor-regulators configuration file.\n\nThe regulators application requires a valid JSON config file.  When the\napplication starts, if a valid file cannot be found, a non-critical\nerror is logged.  This error is already defined in the message registry.\n\nHowever, if the chassis starts powering on and a config file still\ncannot be found, a critical error should be logged.  The voltage\nregulators in the system will not be configured, and this could\npotentially cause hardware damage.  For example, the default output\nvoltage of a regulator may be too high.\n\nThe existing message registry entry cannot be reused because it gets the\nPEL severity from the base BMC error log severity.  The base BMC\nseverity \"Critical\" is mapped to the PEL severity \"critical\".  However,\nin this case the PEL severity \"critical_system_term\" is needed instead.\nAlso, the PowerFault property should be true for the critical entry and\nfalse for the non-critical entry.\n\nTested:\n* Ran the validation tool.\n* Loaded the message registry file into a BMC simulation session.\n* Verified that when the error occurred, the expected PEL was created.\n\nSigned-off-by: Shawn McCarney <shawnmm@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I4950e912481dd71be40a1a176591b235e9d4c668\n",

So to maintain any external dependencies, in this case the bit would be set since the system power on will be stopped."
