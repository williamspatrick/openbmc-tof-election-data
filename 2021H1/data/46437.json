In terms of bifurcating the discussion into yet another review, it's not great;  I would've rather we'd updated the existing review to not lose all the information, but I will leave it up to Patrick on how he wants to merge it;  Maybe he prefers this way."

In my opinion, \"trained speed\" is more nearly to the implementation here. \"speed supported\" may handle by \"MaxPcieType\" in Redfish schama, although the name may be not great.\nFor now, I simply implement the property by getting value from link status register via peci-pcie.
