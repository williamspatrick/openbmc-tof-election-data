    "commitMessage": "op-build: add option to nice build\n\nThe jenkins server, openpower.xyz, has been showing a lot of instability\nrecently. Things like intermittent load times for pages and wget's from\nthe romulus CI job and downstream hardware CI failing.\n\nThe jenkins log has been combed and some issues found in there have been\nfixed, but we continue to see these issues.\n\nI'm not seeing anything in the latest LTS release for Jenkins that would\naddress the issues being seen.\n\nOne theory is that since the op-builds takes place on the same server\nthat is hosting jenkins, that it could be causing some of these issues.\n\nHere's an example of the intermittent error we see. It will usually work\non a retrigger of the job:\n\n+ wget --no-check-certificate https://openpower.xyz/job/run-openbmc-ci/4165/distro=ubuntu,label=builder,target=witherspoon/artifact/openbmc/build/tmp/deploy//images/witherspoon/obmc-phosphor-image-witherspoon.ubi.mtd.tar\n--2020-06-17 10:25:21--  https://openpower.xyz/job/run-openbmc-ci/4165/distro=ubuntu,label=builder,target=witherspoon/artifact/openbmc/build/tmp/deploy//images/witherspoon/obmc-phosphor-image-witherspoon.ubi.mtd.tar\nResolving openpower.xyz (openpower.xyz)... 146.20.65.228\nConnecting to openpower.xyz (openpower.xyz)|146.20.65.228|:443... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 502 Proxy Error\n\nA check of the node hosting jenkins does show some pretty heavy\nperformance hits when op-build is running:\n\ntop - 13:56:27 up 20 days, 21:23,  0 users,  load average: 25.62, 17.52, 14.91\nTasks:   3 total,   1 running,   2 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\n%Cpu(s): 44.4 us,  3.9 sy,  0.0 ni, 50.6 id,  0.9 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.1 si,  0.0 st\nKiB Mem : 30848912 total,  4724308 free, 11229284 used, 14895320 buff/cache\nKiB Swap:        0 total,        0 free,        0 used. 19068488 avail Mem\n\n  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND\n    6 jenkins   20   0 17.390g 8.483g   8316 S 353.3 28.8  64232:14 java\n    1 jenkins   20   0    1148     48      0 S   0.0  0.0   0:45.90 tini\n 61287 jenkins   20   0   42656   3428   3032 R   0.0  0.0   0:00.00 top\n\nSimilar to the bitbake script (build-setup.sh), add an option that the\njenkins job can set to nice the op-build.
