    "commitMessage": "Move sensor collection to all sensors\n\nRedfish's thinking on what sensors should be included in the sensor\ncollection has changed. Roughly two years ago their thinking was\n\"for sensors that are not covered elsewhere in the model-meaning do\nnot duplicate Power and Thermal\" and that is what OpenBMC implemented.\n\nToday, as described in the new thermalSubsystem and powerSubsystem doc\nthe sensor collection should contain all sensors that are associated\nwith that chassis.\n\nLink with: https://redfishforum.com/thread/190/sensorcollection-contain-all-sensors-chassis\n\nAll things considered as \"sensors\" should be included in the Sensor\ncollection.\n\nTo make this transition as easy as possible for clients, create a new\nmeson option, new-powersubsystem-thermalsubsystem. This \"all sensors in\nthe sensor collection\" behavior as well as the new ThermalSubsystem,\nPowerSubsystem, Fans, and Power Supplies schemas will be under this\noption. This option is defaulted to disabled. At a later time, the\ndefault will move to enabled.\n\nMove Redfish SensorCollection to show all sensors from\n/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors with the \"all_sensors\" association for that\nchassis if this option is enabled.\n\nThe SensorCollection is found at /redfish/v1/Chassis/<Id>/Sensors.\n\nTested:\n1. Enabled redfish-new-powersubsystem-thermalsubsystem and\n   validator passes.\n\n2. Performance testing (average of 5 times):\n   a. Redfish validator time:\n      without this patch: 71.375s\n      with this patch:    71.763s\n\n   b. Number of sensors tested:\n      without this patch: 8\n      with this patch:    63\n\n   c. Run `https://${bmc}/redfish/v1/Chassis/chassis/Sensors`:\n      without this patch: 0.197s\n      with this patch:    0.228s\n\nSigned-off-by: George Liu <liuxiwei@inspur.com>\nChange-Id: I2bdddcf616dc72cf0683515c9ab8453bd35eee09\n",

It also should be noted that we don't have filtering yet, so there's no way to just grab the sensor you want, which means the slower we make this, the more impact it has on things that want to read realtime sensor data. \n\n> \n> This new thinking of what the sensor collection is was drove by the new PowerSubsystem / ThermalSubsystem discussion as well as feedback but it isn't tied to the new PowerSubsystem / ThermalSubsystem. \n> \n> This was sent to the mailing list here: https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/openbmc/2021-January/024700.html\n\nYep I saw.  Thanks for doing that.\n\n> \n> And it is has been on the mailing list before with disapproval of Redfish's \"only part of the sensors\". \n> \n> Why do we need a compile time option for the new PowerSubsystem and ThermalSubsystem ?\n> These can co-exist with the old. \n\nI wasn't in the working group, but in the last slideshow I saw, the existing thermal and power schemas now had links back to the sensor collection?  How would we know to create those, and should they be mutually exclusive of the sensors for performance reasons?\n\n> \n> I know clients might get duplicate sensors but we have discussed this on the mailing list, I don't see how that is truly a break, and this long term is better.\n\nMy worry is for the long term how do we get to the final solution, which in this case would be fully deprecating the existing power schemas and moving to the new form.  If we do this in 2 steps (first adding the new sensors, then deprecating the existing thermals), does this pose a worse problem for clients, because we arguably have to make two breaks instead of one?\n\nThis is a case where I really wish Redfish had a version flag that the client posted, so the client could ask for a specific deprecation version, and we could give them what they expect, but alas, that is not meant to be.\n\nI will do my best to get to this research today.  I want to understand the implications of doing this to the redfish tree in terms of performance (how much slower is a full tree dump) and in terms of forward compatibility (what does fully deprecating the thermal schemas look like in the future).\n\nI'm behind on this, so I apologize;  Way too many OpenBMC projects seem to have started at the beginning of the year and are now at the point of having patchsets.  I'm getting ahead of things.\n\nIf you had the numbers on how much slower this made a full tree dump, and the percentage increase in the time to list the sensor schema specifically, that would help."

The new ThermalSubsystem / PowerSubsystem schemas have many benefits over the old. \n\n\"as all of the thermal sensors and power sensors need to be pulled twice\" this is going to be true for even after we move to the new ThermalSubsystem / PowerSubsystem schemas.

How would we know to create those, and should they be mutually exclusive of the sensors for performance reasons?\n\nYes a link from select sensors to the sensor in the sensor collection. \nThe ThermalMetrics / PowerSupply / Fan will only contain the current Reading of the sensor and a link to the Sensor in the Sensor collection so if you wanted to know more (thresholds, etc) you need to look at the Sensor Collection.\n\nWe need a design for how to select the \"summary\" sensors. I saw some chatter on discord about this. I think probably an association. \n\nFrom the mockup:\n\n{\n    \"@odata.type\": \"#ThermalMetrics.v1_0_0.ThermalMetrics\",\n    \"Id\": \"ThermalMetrics\",\n    \"Name\": \"Chassis Thermal Metrics\",\n    \"TemperatureSummaryCelsius\": {\n        \"Internal\": {\n            \"Reading\": 39,\n            \"DataSourceUri\": \"/redfish/v1/Chassis/1U/Sensors/CPU1Temp\"\n        },\n        \"Intake\": {\n            \"Reading\": 24.8,\n            \"DataSourceUri\": \"/redfish/v1/Chassis/1U/Sensors/IntakeTemp\"\n        },\n        \"Ambient\": {\n            \"Reading\": 22.5,\n            \"DataSourceUri\": \"/redfish/v1/Chassis/1U/Sensors/AmbientTemp\"\n        },\n        \"Exhaust\": {\n            \"Reading\": 40.5,\n            \"DataSourceUri\": \"/redfish/v1/Chassis/1U/Sensors/ExhaustTemp\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"TemperatureReadingsCelsius\": [\n        {\n            \"Reading\": 40,\n            \"DeviceName\": \"SystemBoard\",\n            \"DataSourceUri\": \"/redfish/v1/Chassis/1U/Sensors/SysBrdTemp\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Reading\": 24.8,\n            \"DeviceName\": \"Intake\",\n            \"DataSourceUri\": \"/redfish/v1/Chassis/1U/Sensors/IntakeTemp\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Reading\": 39,\n            \"DeviceName\": \"CPUSubsystem\",\n            \"DataSourceUri\": \"/redfish/v1/Chassis/1U/Sensors/CPUTemps\"\n        },\n        {\n\n> \n> > \n> > I know clients might get duplicate sensors but we have discussed this on the mailing list, I don't see how that is truly a break, and this long term is better.\n> \n> My worry is for the long term how do we get to the final solution, which in this case would be fully deprecating the existing power schemas and moving to the new form.  If we do this in 2 steps (first adding the new sensors, then deprecating the existing thermals), does this pose a worse problem for clients, because we arguably have to make two breaks instead of one?\n\nWe aren't going to force clients to the new Power/Thermal schemas for probably a year or more. \nThe new PowerSubsystem/ThermalSubsystem schemas are coming now. \nIn the future there will be a deprecation message for the Old Power/Thermal schemas. \nAfter that, we will eventually turn off the old Power/Thermal schemas.\n\n> \n> This is a case where I really wish Redfish had a version flag that the client posted, so the client could ask for a specific deprecation version, and we could give them what they expect, but alas, that is not meant to be.\n\nWhy does that matter?

See how much slower the request is for the sensor collection ? See how much slower sensor collection and children is now?"

If we move to the new thermal subsystem schemas, that data effectively changes location, so old clients will break.  That's unfortunate, but unavoidable.\n\n> \n> > \n> > I will do my best to get to this research today.

In a few mockups I've seen, the thermal and power schemas are now links, and I wonder if it would be better to do this in a single step, host all the sensors in the sensors collection, and add the links, all under a compile time option.  That seems like it would have the fewest question marks for compatibility, as I'm certain most implementations don't currently handle duplicated values well.\n> > > > > \n> > > > \n> > > > I think this can and should stand on its own. \n> > > > \n> > > > There actually isn't a new sensor schema tied to this. \n> > > > Redfish's thinking on what should be in the sensor collection has just changed. \n> > > > \n> > > > https://redfishforum.com/thread/190/sensorcollection-contain-all-sensors-chassis\n> > > > \n> > > > Clients (e.g. the webui) have a use case to show all the sensors.\n> > > > This change means they can do this in 1 call per chassis vs 3. \n> > > \n> > > Yes, for this use case maybe it's faster, but for those that dump the entire tree, it's slower for no reason, as all of the thermal sensors and power sensors need to be pulled twice.  It also should be noted that we don't have filtering yet, so there's no way to just grab the sensor you want, which means the slower we make this, the more impact it has on things that want to read realtime sensor data. \n> > \n> > This is the direction Redfish choose. \n> > Several Redfish implementations are moving to the new ThermalSubsystem / PowerSubsystem schemas.

Those are up for review now. \n\nI'm suggesting that a 43% performance regression in a commonly polled API (or 100%+ in a later comment, not sure which is right) is a problem, regardless of whether it's using new schemas or old.  If it didn't have the regression, yes, it could easily stand on its own, but considering how bad it is, we should probably investigate how we want to roll it out.\n\n> \n> > \n> > > > \n> > > Cool.

If you plan to work on those problems later, at least comment that, but pushing new patches every day doesn't help get this onto master any faster, and causes a lot of thrash on maintainers that now have to review every single one of your patches to determine if you've fixed the issues already pointed out.\n\nThat is a big reason why this is on patchset 69, and is still no closer to being on master."

Redfish validator time:\n>    without this patch: 71.375s\n>    with this patch:    71.763s\n\n\nFirst off, this isn't a great test.  Redfish validator is a long running test that is mostly consumed by parsing XML schemas, not actually polling the endpoints.  I expected you to take the timing information that the validator produces in the log, and add that up.\n\nOn another note, this data makes no sense.  Each individual sensor collection takes in the range of 500ms to 1 second to run, and we should've added several as part of this patch.  There's only a difference in <400ms between the two?  I find that hard to believe that this isn't more than just measurement noise.\n\n> \n> 2. Number of sensors tested:\n>    without this patch: 8\n>    with this patch:    63\n> \n> 3.

We need to at least have answers for how much faster/slower this makes things, and I would've expected that would've been relatively easy to test with a quick script to grab all sensor values with each flag enabled, but maybe it's harder than I thought?"
