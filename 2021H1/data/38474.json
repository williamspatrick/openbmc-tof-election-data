I had originally suggested making it configurable, but the more I think about it, changing the \"which threshold interface do we look at\" modifies the between-entity associations in a way that I don't really like.  Imagine a card used in multiple systems declaring a critical interface, and expecting it to be used as the shutdown temp, but the baseboard deciding that it's going to use the shutdown severity instead.  I'd much rather we just have the card declare \"this is the temperature at which I need the system to be shut down\" which removes any ambiguity."
