    "commitMessage": "HealthPopulate: Fix imprecise matching\n\nThis commit resolves https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/issues/208\nIssue was an example of common error https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/issues/12\n\nCurrent mechanism creates incorrect propagation of health statuses to additional nodes. Dbus paths are matched solely by looking at beginning of their path using boost::starts_with. To make an example on memory health statuses system, that created unwanted one-sided connection of dimms placed on path \".../dimm2\" and '.../dimm21'. When status object with path '.../dimm21/warning' appeared, it was altering the health setting on both dimms mentioned, just because their beginning path was in fact matching string-wise. That behaviour needed a change to prevent presented imprecise matching.\n\nThis commit adds a check for a slash '/' sign which marks closing of singular path part. Now objects that are compared to their destination paths are guaranteed not to interact with partially cut names where single characters could determine its match. A slash '/' is not required to match to an object if their path is exactly identical (due to paths not being finished by slash) - that is ensured by use of second, alternative match condition checked with boost::equals.\n\nTested: I used bmcweb's memory mechanism (redfish-core/lib/memory.hpp) to assess that statuses are not being incorrectly propagated anymore after introduction of this commit. All dimm health statuses are presented on redfish. I checked health statuses of example dimms that could be vulnerable to this issue, to be exact dimm10 and dimm1. Then, I proceeded to create an warning status (reverse association object: \"warning\") association object (https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/architecture/object-mapper.md#associations) with object path /xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/chassis/motherboard/dimm10 so that getAllStatusAssociations() function in redfish-core/lib/health.hpp could find it and apply health status change. By getting the data before and after creating association object prepared for dimm10, the difference was seen only in status of dimm10, which is appropriate to created association. I repeated the process again for dimm22 and dimm2. Observation of health statuses of both dimms in mentioned cases led to trustworthy conclusion - string-wise comparition does not create unwanted propagations anymore.\n\nSigned-off-by: Karol Wojciechowski <karol.wojciechowski@intel.com>\nChange-Id: Id5e113373f537afa33dc206ed9e2e90598e23f8f\n",
