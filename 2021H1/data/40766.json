    "commitMessage": "Disable nbd proxy from the build\n\nThe inline comment mostly describes this patchset.  As far as OpenBMC is\nconcerned, no platforms or distros implement a backend for this code,\ntherefore this is dead \"unused\" code.  Clearly the authors intended to\nuse it, but haven't been able to upstream anything.\n\nFor the moment, this patchset makes the nbd proxy option unenablable.\nThis will have no impact to any OpenBMC platforms, as there are no\nimplementations of this API in OpenBMC itself, only in downstream forks.\nIt's not clear what the intentions are with this code, so hopefully this\ndisabling and comment encourages those that care about it to interact\nand add some details around how this was designed, and the plans to\nupstream it into OpenBMC.  If not, presumably the code can be deleted\nwithout any harm.\n\nFor timelines, this was checked in Jul 12, 2019, so we're now 20 months\npast its initial entry.  This seems like enough time for the dust to\nhave settled on getting the appropriate things upstreamed.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <ed@tanous.net>\nChange-Id: I217493b97d62282b8781608805bcfe319e6f7d85\n",

Yes, we can accept for now disable of nbd proxy on generic build, although we should be able soon to work towards enabling virtual media application for community. Therefore, we would like to stay with current code related to this feature in other components like bmcweb, or webui. You can expect some reviews related to that in upcoming months (not immediate). We will add you all to reviewers for sure."
