This will be\nachieved by transferring the corresponding LID files.\nBMC has to add entries for those files into the FileTable.json\nso that Hostboot can query for the FileTable and the handle\nand size of the LID beforehand.\n\nThis commit has the changes to the FileTable.json file.\n\nSigned-off-by: Pavithra Barithaya <pavithra.b@ibm.com>\nChange-Id: If33a837e44f6a371f87959279ac850379eadb95e\n",

Futhermore this does not account for patching directories. I have pushed a change to file_table.cpp (https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/pldm/+/43022) which would allow for a order-by-priority list of CSVs as well as a follow up commit of what I think should have all the files that would be needed. \n\nThe list in the follow up commit was compiled by walking the defaultPnorLayout64.xml file from the openpower/pnor repository and looking up the lid ID mapping in the master_json/p10*_file_system_lid_attributes.json files in the single image."
