    "commitMessage": "Fix memory leak issue in Parser factory\n\nInvoking freeParser method in the Parser factory creates\nmemory leak issue. This commit resolves the issue by using\nunique pointers for storing the parser objects.\nWhere the unique pointers will take care of deallocating the\nmemory when the pointer goes out of scope.\n\nTest:\nTested ibm-read-vpd app populating vpd on dbus.\nTested vpd-manager update keyword method working as expected.\n\nSigned-off-by: PriyangaRamasamy <priyanga24@in.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: Ia84694c937d5b6f3c5c196e0e0b6ebf512fda9d9\n",
