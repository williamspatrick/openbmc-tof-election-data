All of this metadata should be optional and under control of the developer being identified. We at least need an email address. It doesn't mean that the file format should be incapable of describing different handles on different communication mediums?\n \n> 2) encourage developers to get involved in the project, if you are involved in the work you are doing, then you already know who you need to talk to\n\nThat feels like a bit of a gatekeeper perspective: how do people bootstrap into the community?"
