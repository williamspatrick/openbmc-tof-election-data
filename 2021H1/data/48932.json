    "commitMessage": "psu-ng: Run validation when PSU is plugged\n\nSubscribe to the Present inventory property so that when a PSU becomes\npresent (it's plugged into the system), it triggers the PSU validation\ncheck so that the user can know if the new PSU(s) is supported on the\nsystem instead of needing to issue a power on to run the validation.\n\nTested: At BMC Ready state, set the Present property on powersupply1 to\nfalse, then true, and check that the validation ran every time the\nPresent property was set to true. Same when changing the Present\nproperty for powersupply0.\n\nChange-Id: I14dc7d5902871284c9c099e81b45e78e4abf83bc\nSigned-off-by: Adriana Kobylak <anoo@us.ibm.com>\n",

I tried a couple things like class fwd declarations. Maybe somebody knows of an elegant trick to have 2 classes that depend on each other, or some other ideas on how we could do this.\nAnother thought is to move the validation function to be by itself, like in utils, but i haven't looked in detail what would that take because it depends on functions provided by the psu manager and power supply classes."

It got left in as a transitional thing from phosphor-gpio-presence to using libgpiod due to how Everest moved presence pins to a PCA95xx device, making the usage of gpio-keys almost impossible.\n\nWe can probably refactor that out somehow... and end up with just PSUManager having the match/watch."
