    "commitMessage": "sensorcommands: Cache sensor data at 60s interval when requested for SDR\n\nTemporary tuning to mitigate performance issue due to inconsistent dbus\ncall performance in getSensorMap().\n\nMoving the sensor update time to after finish building the map allow the\ndata to be cached for the the build time plus sensorMapUpdatePeriod.\n\nA SDR scan is observed to take about half a minute, and SDR is scanned\nfor 17 times during host boot, which adds minutes to host\nboot time. However, sensor reading is seldom invoked during boot, and\nthe host does not poll for SDR after the first one.\nBased on these facts, deploy a trick that turn up cache time to 60\nseconds to reduce dbus traffic when SDR is requested, while the sensor\nreading update interval is not affected.\nNo time reduction to `ipmitool sdr` command, because it polls for\nboth SDR and sensor reading.\n\nTested:\nAfter issuing host reboot command in BMC, host boot time recorded is\nreduced from 14:40 to 11:02.\nThe fan sensor is still observed to be updated every 2 seconds.\n\nSigned-off-by: Alex Qiu <xqiu@google.com>\nChange-Id: If45f5b850854ff5888909636507d1c47840d17b6\nSigned-off-by: Willy Tu <wltu@google.com>\n",

Since we never start the cache time, it will keep trying the failed dbus calls and increase the boot time. I can see this being an issue."
