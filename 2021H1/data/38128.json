    "commitMessage": "ThermalController: Adding flag to negate worst-margin input\n\nThe PID math can become easier,\nif the input to the margin PID loop is negated.\n\nIn other words, flip the sign of the computed worst-margin value,\nbefore passing it as input to the margin PID loop.\n\nThe setpoint is also correspondingly negated,\nso that it can still properly be compared with the input.\n\nThis has the beneficial effect of having greater (more positive)\nmargins represent hotter temperatures, which should correspond\nto greater (more positive) fan RPM speeds.\n\nIn other words, both numbers will move in the same direction,\nmaking it easier to work with the PID coefficients,\nas the math will then be similar to a temperature PID loop.\n\nThis is optional, to avoid breaking existing behavior.\nTo enable, use \"--negate\" on command line,\nor create \"/etc/thermal.d/negate\" file (content does not matter).\n\nSigned-off-by: Josh Lehan <krellan@google.com>\nChange-Id: I1a537d6dbfcabf067c1714e4d2244ced2f6c5886\n",

In \"temp\" type, the highest numeric temperature is the one fed into the loop .  Assuming negated margin sensors go -100 (very cool) to 100 (very hot) they would use the exact same logic, right?  The highest numeric sensor would be the one used to do the control?\nThis is essentially the reason why dbus-sensors DIMM, DTS, and NVMe Sensors are described as \"temp\" type, even though some of them are effectively margin sensors and unitless, to keep the math the same."
