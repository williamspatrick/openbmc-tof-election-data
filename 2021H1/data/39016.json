I intentionally don't want to go into the details of how the DTFM process works, as it's not our responsibility to define how they operate, so I don't really want us documenting their the process here in a place where we have no say in it, and it isn't binding.\n\nSaid another way, I want the discussion about the DMTF process to happen on DMTF forums, not OpenBMC forums.  This doc is meant to provide context to how OpenBMC interfaces with their process.\n\n> If possible, message the new feature through the normal OpenBMC communications channels to ensure OpenBMC is properly represented in the meeting/forum."

If it's one of the first two, the hope is that we would go to the relevant communities and get consensus on a standard.  If it's the 3rd, then an OEM resource is completely reasonable.\n\n> Do you want to say that this is up to the maintainer to decide how the API is going to be written under OEM : Vendor?\n\nI'm not sure I'm following the question, so if I'm answering the wrong question, I apologize.\n\nKeeping Redfish resources in line with the specification, as well as keeping them within the bounds of what looks like a normal redfish and hypermedia resource is the job of the maintainers, regardless of whether they're an OEM resource or not.  Gunnar is a bmcweb maintainer and has a very good handle on both the DMTF community, as well as what Redfish resources are supposed to look like, so I don't expect IBM to have any problem navigating the waters here.\n\nFor some concrete examples.  If an OEM writer wanted to check in a resource that;\n1. Didn't have CSDL or json specifications.\n2. Decided to use snake_case instead of CamelCase for property names.\n3. Didn't model things as a hypermedia API\n4. Made changes to non-OEM resources from within their OEM resources.\n5. Didn't pass the redfish validator.\n\nIt would be up to the maintainers to prevent that.  Hopefully that answers your question.\n\nAs an aside, I'm much more worried about a perception that individuals that don't have a company standing are getting shut out by this policy, hence trying to write this down and apply the same standards to everyone."
