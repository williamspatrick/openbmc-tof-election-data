I tested it out and saw if I changed the power limit on `chassis` it changed it on all the chassis'. So getting the power limit from the first chassis in the collection would work regardless of how many chassis there are because they will all be the same value (same for patching)\n\nWould something like this work for walking the redfish paths? https://gist.github.com/dixsie/bec184c448bae501c6181741920fe454"
