A user PATCHing the property should not get a different order back than the one they sent in.\n2. Define behavior when the interfaces don't match.  I suspect this should involve just reading from the first interface and relaying that list, but I could be convinced it should be the full interface list with duplicates removed, so long as #1 is still obeyed, and we have consistent, user driven ordering."

It cannot update NTPServer correctly, which will cause NTP synchronization to fail.\n\nOr we can use a global configuration to get the information of the currently active network card, like this:\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/47342/1"

Ordering should not be changed server-side.\n\nThere's also a lot of questions around if we're looking at multiple interfaces, what happens when they don't contain the same data?  This patchset defines the behavior as \"the superset of all interfaces\", but that doesn't really follow CRUD either, because any modification to that, will now set it on all interfaces.\n\n\n\"to identify whether the current Ethernet is active.\"\nThat doesn't seem like it would matter in this case?\n\n> @edtanous, NTP server should be per interface basis, Systemd networkd also supports that.\n\nFeel free to propose that to DMTF then?  In this context we're discussing how to get the existing interfaces to work and follow Restful semantics given that they don't match.  The initial patchset for this defaulted everything to eth0, because it was assumed that all BMCs had a dedicated NIC at the time.  That assumption clearly doesn't work for those platforms, so we need to figure out defined behavior for those cases.  Clearly my \"set it on the first interface found\" idea wouldn't meet the needs, but we need to come up with something that has defined, CRUD behavior, even when the interfaces don't match.
