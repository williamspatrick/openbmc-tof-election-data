If so, how does each instance forward host information to the ipmi daemon? \n\nAtleast for me this section is vague, it will need a block diagram and some more details on how the host information is forwarded by netipmid (instance/instances) to ipmid just like how ipmbbridged forwards the host specific information to ipmi daemon."

The interface can be a physical or virtual.\n\nI think it is possible to have two (or more) network interfaces per host. The config file needs to be flexible to support more than one interface per host.\n\nWe can have a config file for the netipmid with the following example. Please let me know your thoughts on this.\n\n{ \"Host\": \"1\",\n\"Interface-1\": \"eth0\",\n\"Interface-2\": \"eth1\",\n\"Interface-3\": \"veth4\",\n\"Interface-4\": \"veth5\"\n},\n{ \"Host\": \"2\",\n\"Interface-1\": \"eth2\",\n\"Interface-2\": \"eth3\",\n\"Interface-3\": \"veth1\",\n\"Interface-4\": \"veth2\"\n},"
