    "commitMessage": "obmc-init: Add support for rwfs modules\n\nCurrently, we mount our rwfs without having a kernel module dirctory\ndirectory available, even though the rofs has this mounted. In the\nfuture we probably want to defer mounting the rwfs until after the root\npvito, but for now we can make rwfs modules work by mounting the modules\nfolder in our initrd until we pivot.\n\nTested: RWFS mounts on a machine with jffs2 built as a module\n\nChange-Id: Ibc0e815d17e9cd28714dd32f62b7ad218a15eee0\nSigned-off-by: William A.

For those with fast spi busses this is less of a big deal, but for us it results in a couple of seconds of savings at load time and then more at initialization time as we can delay loading only the things we need. The rwfs is maybe not the most useful target of this when it is serially being mounted in the initd, but once we can move it to lazy loading it's code that isn't needed prior to the availability of squashfs. I'm not worried about the slight memory overhead due to our system constraints."
