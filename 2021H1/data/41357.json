    "commitMessage": "Replace deprecated Linux-PAM modules\n\nThis replaces deprecated Linux-PAM modules with supported modules:\n - pam_pwquality replaces pam_cracklib.\n - pam_faillock replaces pam_tally2.\n\nThis has a modified copy of the libpwquality recipe which avoids\nimporting the Python distutils3-base.  This is needed to keep image\nsize small.\n\nThis updates /etc/pam.d config files to maintain the same OpenBMC\nproject default values as before.  Note that some config values\nmoved out of /etc/pam.d and into /etc/security.\n\nThis establishes a new systemd service to convert modified PAM\nconfig files to use the new modules.  This is needed in case the\nconfig files were modified.  (Config files are added to a\nreadwrite overlay on the BMC's file system when they are modified.)\nSuch files are not affected by an image update and require special\nhandling such as the conversion service provides.\n\nThis adds the priv-noaccess group needed by phosphor-user-manager.\n\npam_pwquality was selected over pam_passwdqc because of better security\nand compatibility with pam_cracklib.\n\nNote pam_faillock is necessarily configured into the pam module stack\ndifferently than pam_tally2.\n\nThis patchset causes a BMC operational change:\n- The pam_tally2 command (invoked from the BMC's command line) is no\n  longer present.  If you used the \"pam_tally2 -u USER -r\" command\n  to unlock a user after repeated authentication failures, change to\n  use: faillock --user USER --reset\n\nCompatibility note / migration issue.  If your BMC cannot authenticate\nusers after installing this change, the cause might be an overlayfs file\nhiding the new /etc/pam.d/common-auth file.  To find out, use\n`grep deny= /etc/pam.d/common-auth` on your BMC.  If it shows \"tally2\"\nthen your BMC is affected.  The recovery is to delete the overlay file,\nto factory reset the BMC, or manually-install the changed files.\nThe convert-pam-configs service is intended to handle this problem.\n\nNote that account lockout information is lost and reset when the BMC\nreboots.  Note that if the BMC has its default configuration or is\ninternally misconfigured (directory /run/faillock missing) then no\naccount locking is performed, meaning unlimited login attempts.\n\nNote that accounts that were recently unlocked due to expiration of\nthe AccountLockoutDuration will show as locked until the next\nauthentication attempt.  The scenario is:\n- Lock the account due to excessive authentication failures.\n- Wait for the AccountLockoutDuration to elapse.\n- At this point, the account *is* unlocked and the user can\n  authenticate with a correct password, but the APIs (both D-Bus and\n  Redfish) show the account is locked.  This condition persists\n  until the next authentication attempt using that username.\nThis behavior is due to a limitation in how the faillock command\noutput is interpreted in combination with the faillock module\nconfiguration in the pam configuration files.\nSee https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/issues/327\n\nTested: as follows, for local users only (not tested with LDAP)\n\nNote OpenBMC configuration defaults to an AccountLockoutThreshold\nvalue of 0 which does not lock account passwords no matter how many\nconsecutive failed authentication attempts.  To configure this on\nthe BMC, for example, use:\ncurl -X PATCH https://${bmc}/redfish/v1/AccountService\n  -d '{\"AccountLockoutThreshold\": 3, \"AccountLockoutDuration\": 60}'\n\nTested update scenarios:\n1. Install from scratch.  Success.\n2. Install over firmware which had old PAM configs.  Success.\n\nTested update scenarios for the convert-pam-configs service.\nThe tests direction has details.\n\nTested changing the password via various interfaces:\n- the passwd command\n- the PATCH Refish AccountService {Password: NEW}\n- SSH (accessible only when the password is expired)\n- IPMI user set password (accessible for unexpired password)\n\nTested both good and bad (unacceptable) passwords.\n\nTested account lockout after N bad passwords\nTested unlock via Redfish.\n\nAlso, because its implementation changed, ensure reading and writing the\nD-Bus User AccountPolicy RememberOldPasswordTimes property continues to\nwork.  There is no Redfish API for this.\n\nSigned-off-by: Joseph Reynolds <joseph-reynolds@charter.net>\nChange-Id: I7b712cf7cfbf7b0bc79da42f822540baee66ca4f\n",

Running `strings /usr/bin/phosphor-user-manager | grep tally` confirms this:\npam_tally2.so\n/usr/sbin/pam_tally2\nand does not show any faillock command strings.\n\nIs there a way to remove the co-req change?  Observe that the changes that need to be made to PAM config files (libpam recipe) and phosphor-user-manager are tied together.  For user management (authentication and admin functions) to function, they really do need to be changed at the same time.\n\nIs there a way to remove the co-req from the build process?  I don't see a way.  The obvious sequence is:\n 1. Merge a change that enables with the old & new PAM modules.  Specifically, to make libpam_1.3.1 also build the faillock and pwquality modules.\n 2. Then merge the phosphor-user-manager commit.\n 3. Then merge this commit (after rebase).\n\nIn this way, phosphor-user-manager would start up okay.  However, functions would break after the phosphor-user-manager commit merged because its functions (to use the new faillock command) wouldn't match the PAM config files provided by this commit.\n\nAlternately, we could enhance phosphor-user-manager to adapt to conditions (old vs new  pam config), but that seems excessive (and error prone) for a throwaway change."

For any new platform project / generation this service is totally not required. Hence exposing it in Phosphor-user-manager with a flag to enable / disable will make life easier. So people can use directly new stuff for their new platforms\n2. Till this service is finished, phosphor-user-manager must not be started to do the initial query. If phosphor-user-manager races against this service, then initial values may be inconsistent. Hence there must be a dependency. If this .sh can be directly started in phosphor-user-manager, then dependency can be solved."
