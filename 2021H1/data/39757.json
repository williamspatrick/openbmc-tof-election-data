    "commitMessage": "Fix websocket ownership model\n\nWithin bmcweb, websockets are weird.  They are roughly the only thing\nthat breaks the model of \"HttpConnection always owns the connection for\nthe full lifetime\".  Because websockets are two way, and the\nHTTPConnection is set up for request->response, the socket itself needs\nto be std::moved off to the Websocket class, where it can do the\nhandshaking, and own the socket for the rest of its lifetime.  This is\nalready an iffy thing.  The latest code imposes an ownership and\nordering problem, in that HttpConnection needs to stay alive while the\nwebsocket it running, due to the fact that the websocket class can\nactually shift back to request->response, if the websocket onopen\nhandler deems it be.\n\nThe way this was implemented was by relying on some undefined behavior,\nas the responses were being sent after Websocket::ws had already taken\nownership of the socket, and had negotiated a websocket session.  To a\nclient this would look something like\nClient: I want a websocket\nServer: Here's your websocket\nClient: Start reading\nServer: This URI isn't found (404).\n\nOnce a websocket has been created, it needs to be destroyed with a\nwebsocket disconnect, and can't be closed with a 404.\n\nWhich brings us to this patchset.  This patchset moves the ownership\nmodel back to what it was, where websockets were upgraded implicitly.\nThe only user of the \"might 404\" behavior was nbd, which has been moved\nto a proper websocket close in the case of a non-existent endpoint.\nThis should have no impact on the webui.\n\nAsyncResp has also had its func method removed, and the onopen endpoints\nupdated, as there's no longer a use for responding with a static\nresponse to a websocket after its been negotiated.\n\nTested:\nLoaded webui, seems load properly.\nTested with scripts/websocket_test.py.  Websockets seem to work\nproperly.\n\nTried various URIs, and saw no more seg faults on weird socket behavior,\nalthough I did see one disconnect, which is unrelated.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: Iea9cfa854312f06750b90446258f4a0e2aba1b7b\n",
