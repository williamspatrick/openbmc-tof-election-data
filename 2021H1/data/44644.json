If it is set to false, create subscription is\nrejected\n\nTested by:\n 1. Set \"ServiceEnabled\" to false, subscribe to events\n    Command fails with status 500-GeneralError\n 2.

They are separate, although related resources.\n\n\nWhile I don't think this patch is incorrect in terms of the Redfish specification, I don't think what we did originally is incorrect either, and considering we're not actually shutting down the resources for EventService, there's no real reason to enforce this upon the user."
