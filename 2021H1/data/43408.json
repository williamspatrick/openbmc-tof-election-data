In our case, with setFuncOnPresent = true, the fan will not become func again until its been unplugged/replugged regardless of the func state of its sensors.

I guess maybe your fan control code wants the FRUs to be nonfunc so it can know when to go to high speed?"

To me, the use of numSensorFailsForNonFunc = 0 means that a system's fans will only be monitored by the individual rotors and the fan FRU enclosure is not of concern. And then, of course, fan control would also be configured based on the individual rotor's functional states only.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure how the thermal team is going to configure fan control since they have never had the option to go to high speed based on the individual tachs and this seems to be implementing the path of only using the fan FRU's functional state when driving to high speed as they're use to."
