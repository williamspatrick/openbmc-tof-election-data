    "commitMessage": "Add Privileges to Websockets\n\nThis commit adds Privileges to Websockets.\nIn the current implementation, once a rule is upgraded (i.e. from\nBaseRule to WebSocket), there is no provision to add priviliges.\nIn this commit, WebSocket inherits PrivilegeParameterTraits to enable\nprivileges.\n\nAlso, in the earlier implementation, .privilege() was called after\nBMCWEB_ROUTE(). This results in adding those privileges to the Base rule\nthat is created. By moving the privileges() below websocket(), the\nprivileges are applied to the websocket.\n\nTested:\n - websocket_test.py Passed\n - Admin and Operator users are able to access KVM on WebUI\n - Readonly User was unable to access KVM on WebUI\n\nSigned-off-by: P Dheeraj Srujan Kumar <p.dheeraj.srujan.kumar@intel.com>\nChange-Id: Ia56c1daa7780737fa9a4a8f2010392b0750fd0d6\n",

If needed, lets prefer composition over inheritence, but I suspect the answer here is easier.\n\nWebSocketRule already inherits from BaseRule.  Considering that all rules will need privileges, I suspect that the two methods that you've put in PrivilegeParameterTraits should be going in BaseRule, which would let them apply to all rules."
