VPD keyword values can provide this\ninformation about the hardware.\n\nAdd a new class to obtain hardware VPD from the D-Bus\nxyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Decorator.Asset interface.\n\nAlso define an abstract base class and a mock implementation to\nenable use of gmock in test cases related to VPD.\n\nTested:\n* Verified VPD values were successfully obtained from D-Bus.\n* Verified VPD values were cached.\n* Tested where object path was invalid.\n* Tested where keyword was invalid.\n* Verified cached VPD values were cleared when machine powered on.\n* For the complete test plan, see\n  https://gist.github.com/smccarney/519a54353361e28b1d25f5783c15f471\n\nSigned-off-by: Shawn McCarney <shawnmm@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: Id08e8bca8db6421d46669c495e8a9432e45a1fd6\n",
