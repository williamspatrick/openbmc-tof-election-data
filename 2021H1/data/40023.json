It stops once it finds\n    an OWNERS file that has \u201cinherited\u201d set to false (by default it\u2019s true.)\n\nAdd 'inherited: false' on all OWNERS files so that we do not have an\naccidental inheritence of ownership from the root OWNERS file.  This\ngives us some additional protection that someone who has root-level\nownership does not override the review of someone with meta-layer\nownership.\n\nChange-Id: I8b982b49f513187dcebae168e1f457d4e4a48d04\nSigned-off-by: Patrick Williams <patrick@stwcx.xyz>\n",

Is it because meta-yadro is in the patch set and I'm the owner? I don't remember having the +2 right before anywhere except meta-yadro subtree. This is bit confusing now.\n\nFor the moment, everyone can +2, although nobody can merge unless you're an OWNER.  This is a short term cheat to work around the fact that we don't have an \"all owners\" group, which I need to chat with brad and andrew G about how hard it would be to build.\n\n> \n> @Ed - it seems like we'll need some details on what the difference is between +1 and +2 for owners now.\n\nI plan to write a doc clarifying this a little, but the short version is that it means the same thing as when you're the maintainer of a repo.\n\n+1 means \"This change looks good, but can't merge yet\"\n+2 means \"This change is ready to merge\"\n\nOnce an owner for each file changes has +2ed, the submit button becomes available."
