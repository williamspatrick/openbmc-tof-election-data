You were right in thinking that separating out your patches into a series would make them easier to review.  I'd highly recommend learning how git works and how to use git rebase -i to your advantage to be able to mix and match patches without them necessarily being on master.\n\n> Since my thought was in error on the merge order it I choose\n> to stick with the first one and sticking with it now.\n> I am still learning."
