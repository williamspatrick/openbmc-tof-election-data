In the case\ndriving the creation of this interface, it will be the backing store for\nPLDM sensors used to alert the host that there are thermal issues and\nthat it needs to start getting ready for a power off.\n\nSigned-off-by: Matt Spinler <spinler@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I77109f31fad589dd49a00184457271eaaefc5ca6\n",

Not to mention fan RPM thresholds are moving targets anyway, and we're going to have delays between a X number of fans fail and when the alert is triggered.\n\nin the case of the temperature, in our case we're going to have 2 different levels of ambient temp alerts (so I will use this interface on 2 object paths), one of which is isn't reversible, so even if the temperature drops, it cannot prevent a power off.  Also, we're going to have hysteresis in the alerts, so the temp at which the alert is triggered is different than the one for when it will be turned off (for the alert that can be turned off at all).\n\nI suppose another option would just be to just use the Object.Enable interface on some unique object paths and call it a day."
