Depth  - This property represents the depth (length) of the chassis\n              in millimeters, as specified by the manufacturer.\n2. Height - This property represents the height of the chassis\n              in millimeters, as specified by the manufacturer.\n3. Width  - This property represents the width of the chassis\n              in millimeters, as specified by the manufacturer.\n\nOn Nvidia's platforms, the source of this information is firmware running\non GPUs or other entities connected to the GPU and to the BMC.\nThe information itself is served to the BMC using a proprietary protocol.\nThe BMC has a daemon that implements this protocol and then hosts the\ninformation on D-Bus.\n\nDBus Interfaces gerrit dependency:\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/43433\n\nRedfish validator passed.\n\nTested:\n$ curl -k -H \"X-Auth-Token: $token\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n-X GET https://${bmc}/redfish/v1/Chassis/GPU1\n{\n  \"@odata.id\": \"/redfish/v1/Chassis/GPU1\",\n  \"@odata.type\": \"#Chassis.v1_14_0.Chassis\",\n  \"ChassisType\": \"Module\",\n  \"DepthMm\": 900.1,\n  \"HeightMm\": 900.12,\n  \"Id\": \"GPU1\",\n  \"Name\": \"GPU1\",\n  \"WidthMm\": 900.11,\n  \"UUID\": \"7ee8874a-a7f0-11eb-bcbc-0242ac130002\"\n}\n\nSigned-off-by: Sharad Yadav <sharady@nvidia.com>\nChange-Id: I1c76aeec5ed5bff81da7242bf9c54e85f3c3218d\n",

While I do want to see these features made available, if the project is unable to support them because the useful half the code has been held back, that doesn't help the project overall, and means that this code effectively doesn't function for anyone in the open source capacity, which largely defeats the \"Open\" part of OpenBMC.\n\nWe discussed a little on discord.\n\nI understand your company has worries about disclosing hardware early, which I can respect.  The best advice I can think of would be to implement these features against something that's already shipping and public (doesn't even have to be your companies hardware).  That would make sure that the appropriate backends existed for these things, and they could be tested and used by someone on a supported system.  I'm sure there are people in open source (myself included) that would help you to test on other systems if you're unable to source your own.\n\nFrom my perspective, as a maintainer, I can't maintain code that I can't see.  If this interface needed to change tomorrow, which happens from time to time, there's no way to make sure it doesn't break if there's no backend for it.\n\nHopefully that somewhat explains that rationale for waiting for backend support on this patch."
