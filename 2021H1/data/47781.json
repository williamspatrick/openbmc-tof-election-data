Try to discourage them from being changed by\nremoving them from meson.build just in case that suggests that perhaps\nthey are meant to be overriden.\n\nAs the DBus names are the only content in config.h, config.h can be\nremoved completely.\n\nChange-Id: I654473333932a8626a0ace5ee5a865dd14aaf296\nSigned-off-by: Brad Bishop <bradleyb@fuzziesquirrel.com>\n",
