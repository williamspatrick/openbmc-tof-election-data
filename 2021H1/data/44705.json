    "commitMessage": "log_services: Add AdditionalDataURI to Post Code log entries\n\n- Need to support the Additional Data URI on Post Code log service.\n  IBM progress codes are typically 72 bytes including a primary code\n  (8 bytes) and a secondary code that contains hex words that would\n  provide additional details on the core problem during boot hangs.\n  These secondary hex words would be in this Additional Data URI.\n\n- Need to check for the secondary progress code(std::vector<uint8_t>)\n  If it is empty, then do not generate the Additional Data URI.\n  If it is not empty, then generate Additional Data URI for that\n  particular post entry.\n\n- This commit is not alone for IBM, it is a generic code that should\n  work on every system.\n  As per the recent PDI change that went into Progress code structure\n  https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/commit/9a96970ebb93eb1f495c200801343a4d1c53977c#diff-0aad0ef8ed32e2652256f50357eede1aedd6ff1398df1bb1a121ad9125916c5f\n  1. The primary code(uint64_t) is what we see in the BIOSPOSTCode\n     Message registry.\n  2. The secondary code(array[byte]) is the entire raw buffer which\n     could be used to offload the information out of BMC.\n  This should not impact any systems that does not have a secondary\n  code, as if the secondary code is empty -> we will not populate the\n  AdditionalDataURI at all.\n\nTested:\n- Ran Redfish validator which instructed to bump the odata.type from\n  v1_4_0 to v1_8_0 and passed.\n\n- Verified the new AdditionalDataURI was correct for\n  LogServices/PostCodes/Entries/<str>:\n  $ curl -k\nhttps://127.0.0.1:2443/redfish/v1/Systems/system/LogServices/PostCodes/Entries/B1-1\n  {\n\t\"@odata.id\": \"/redfish/v1/Systems/system/LogServices/PostCodes/Entries\",\n\t\"@odata.type\": \"#LogEntry.v1_8_0.LogEntry\",\n\t\"Description\": \"Collection of POST Code Log Entries\",\n\t\"Members\": [\n\t  {\n        \"@odata.id\": \"/redfish/v1/Systems/system/LogServices/PostCodes/Entries/B1-1\",\n\t    \"@odata.type\": \"#LogEntry.v1_8_0.LogEntry\",\n\t    \"AdditionalDataURI\": \"/redfish/v1/Systems/system/LogServices/PostCodes/Entries/B1-1/attachment\",\n\t    ... ...\n      }\n\t],\n\t\"Members@odata.count\": 1,\n\t\"Name\": \"BIOS POST Code Log Entries\"\n  }\n\nSigned-off-by: George Liu <liuxiwei@inspur.com>\nChange-Id: I1702c990a6a3c3f5513162e0e04237371597676a\n",
