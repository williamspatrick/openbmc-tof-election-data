    "commitMessage": "Fix the same static IP setting from DHCP\n\nWhen the BMC already has a DHCP IP address, and we set the same static\nIP address, it fails.\n\nIt is because the AddressMap is a std::map and the code was using\nemplace() to add the new created IP address. If the address is already\nin the map, the emplace() does not replace the object but does nothing.\n\nChange the emplace() to insert_or_assign(), so that the newly created IP\naddress is added into the map.\n\nResolves: openbmc/phosphor-networkd#38\nTested: Verify the static IP address could be set.\n\nSigned-off-by: Lei YU <yulei.sh@bytedance.com>\nChange-Id: Ic6756c81c4981589c8bbe88e990304ed1df6b59a\n",
