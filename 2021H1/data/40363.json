    "commitMessage": "build-unit-test-docker: invalidate base image weekly\n\nDocker will cache an image built with the exact same commands,\nso we only get latest Ubuntu packages rarely.  Add a date-based\necho command into the early stages of the base image build so\nthat we regularly get updates to all the packages in the base\nimage.\n\nThis invalidation, via echo, is only performed when running under\na Jenkins-like context.  The purpose of this distinction is so that\nwe are more likely to cache failures induced by an underlying OS\nupdate in CI, but when developers run this script locally they rarely\nsee an invalidation that is not due to a code package update.\n\nAdd an environment variable option \"FORCE_DOCKER_BUILD\" which can be\nset by developers to bypass the Docker cache and force all images\nto be rebuilt, just in case they really want to do that sort of thing.\n\nSigned-off-by: Patrick Williams <patrick@stwcx.xyz>\nChange-Id: Iec92ebada513975d0806099083384dfca623f144\n",

I'm also finding that maybe this was a little too aggressive and I'm too often having to rebuild the linux-headers package which requires downloading all the source again.\n\nI think I'll add something to this change to detect that we're running on Jenkins and inject this date code only in that case (unless another environment variable is added).\n\nHow often do you think it is reasonable for us to do an apt-get?  Right now we end up with the image cached and we never re-pull.  Is once a day fine on CI?  Once a week?  Once a month?"

Let me know if you'd like https://jenkins.openbmc.org/job/ci-repository/ to set a ENV variable to specify it's a jenkins config (or that it just wants this feature if you want to keep it a non-jenkins specific flag)."
