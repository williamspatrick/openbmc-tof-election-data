    "commitMessage": "Add PerformService privilege\n\nThis commit creates a new OemOpenBMCPerformService privilege.\n\nBackground: OpenBMC implementations support sensitive operations which\nmay not be appropriate for a BMC administrator to use.  For example:\n - A manufacturing team may need to set a machine serial number or run\n   host operations intended only for the manufacturing process.\n - A field service agent may need to set a MAC address after replacing\n   a network FRU device, or to access the sensitive innards of the host.\n\nThe Redfish standard focuses on the BMC admin and operator experience\nand does not support the use cases as identified above.  Redfish\nrefusals to add such functions to the standard are documented here:\n - https://redfishforum.com/thread/333/proposed-new-servicerep-role-privilege\n - https://redfishforum.com/thread/393/modify-schema-propertys-permission\n - https://redfishforum.com/thread/397/redfish-direction-update-eeproms\n\nThe Redfish solution is to allow Redfish services (such as BMCWeb) to\ndefine OEM Privileges and custom Roles per the Redfish privilege model\ndescribed in the DSP0266 spec Security details > Authorization.  In\nparticular, subsection Privilege model > Roles.\n\nThe main idea is to protect access to sensitive operations by\nrequiring the OemOpenBMCPerformService privilege.  This privilege\nshould not be applied to standard Redfish operations.  The new\nprivilege is intended only for Redfish OEM operations and for\nvendor-specific operations hosted on BMCWeb but outside of the\nRedfish model.\n\nTo clarify, this commit only defines the new privilege.  It does not\nadd it to any operation-to-privilege maps.  And it only adds it to the\nAdministrator role.\n\nUse cases:\n1. The BMC Administrator has all privileges, including the\n   OemOpenBMCPerformService, and they are allowed to use all BMC\n   operations.  This is the default configuration.\n2. The BMC Administrator has all privileges except for the service\n   privileges, and the intention is admin users are not allowed to\n   perform service operations.  A separate service account has the\n   service privilege, for example, in a custom ServiceAgent role.\n\nThis commit takes the first step toward enabling the second use case.\n\nTested:\nThe privileges are applied correctly.  Specifically tested the admin\nuser can continue to use the ConfigureUsers privilege, for example\nexample they can create and modify users.  Operators cannot.\n\nGET /redfish/v1/AccountService/Roles/Administrator shows the correct\nprivileges in the AssignedPrivileges and OemPrivileges properties,\nas do the other roles.\n\nSigned-off-by: Joseph Reynolds <joseph-reynolds@charter.net>\nChange-Id: Idaafdc42877c78fc6644687d14d567490d3f6fea\n",

OEM, by definition they will need to be configurable for everyone needs, so I'm not particularly inclined to approve a \"concrete\" OEM privilege.  Considering the current Redfish implementation implements the base privilege registry that's published by the standard, that should be available to consumers as an option (and probably the default option).\n\n> \n> Changing topics, I believe the IBM specific rest APIs will follow the Redfish privilege/authorization model,\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how this works in practice.  I would prefer to not spread IBMisms through the generic privilege code, so please plan on making a generic API for this, that the IBM system can inject into to do its system-specific things.  In this way, we keep the company specific URLs contained, which should aboid having to write\n\nif (ibm)\nelse if (google)\nelse if (intel)\nelse if (quanta)\n\nin a bunch of places.\n\n> using custom IBM roles and OemIBM privileges per the Redfish spec.  No new privilege system is needed.\n\nI don't think the privilege system itself needs to change, it's perfectly capable of being dynamic, and is built at runtime based on the routes already.\n\n\n\n\nPS, in general, I only put WIP on the title and topic, as marking things WIP in gerrit prevents any sort of discussion until the patchset is opened."
