    "commitMessage": "core: Drop messages sent before binding enables transmission\n\nSome bindings (astlpc) have a handshake that must occur before packets\ncan be sent across the bus, but after the binding instance has been\nconstructed. Similarly, some bindings (astlpc) require coordination of\nresources between endpoints as part of regular operation, which\nmotivates the existence of the associated `tx_enabled` state.\n\nIf a binding invokes mctp_binding_set_tx_enabled() with a `true`\nargument it implies that all required handshaking has been completed\n(if it had not, we still would not be able to send packets).\n\nSwitch `tx_enabled` from a boolean to a ternary state machine to capture\nthe `constructed` state of a binding (before required handshaking has\ncompleted). Further, error out if mctp_message_tx_on_bus() is invoked\nwith a binding in the `constructed` state, as it's possible the\ninformation required to correctly packetise the provided message is\ninvalid.\n\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Jeffery <andrew@aj.id.au>\nChange-Id: If4baf07ab5fe7edd7f522fac29e32fc5c2a6105d\n",

There's no real impact on the binding implementations unless they chooses to care (e.g. astlpc decides to care a bit later in the series). What's perhaps a bit subtle is the expectation that bindings zero-initialise struct mctp_binding, but given we're going to shift the state back to struct mctp_bus this becomes less of a concern. Does shifting the state back to struct mctp_bus lift your concern with the commit message?"
