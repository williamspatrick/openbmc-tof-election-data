The ibm-read-vpd application parses\nthe IBM based fru vpd and updates it into D-Bus.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jinu Joy Thomas <jinu.joy.thomas@in.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I004d46d48932e3a5acce34cc6923979929be8bb8\n",

This made us \"remove\" the udev rule file in do_install_append_rainier (see PS1).\n\nSince that seemed like a workaround, we felt it would be cleaner if the IBM VPD parser had its own recipe and package group."

IMO different command line arguments for reading different types of vpd might not be optimal from a usability pov. - I think users would appreciate being able to use the same application and command line options to interact with the vpd logic... regardless of what format it is stored in.\n\nbut I don't maintain openpower-vpd-parser, so this just me waxing philosophical."

Unless there are reasons to deviate from that norm, I don't want to.  You'll have to convince me that there is a valid reason to do this differently in the openpower-vpd-parser case.
