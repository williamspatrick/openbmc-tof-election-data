    "commitMessage": "Add SameSite=Strict on Set-Cookie\n\nSet SameSite to Strict since OpenBMC does not have functionality\nthat requires Lax or None.\n\nSameSite Strict provides a little protection against CSRF attacks\nby ensuring the cookie is only sent to requests originating from\nthe same site that set the cookie.\n\nThis came from some discussion on discord.\n\nFrom https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie\n\nSameSite=<samesite-value> Optional\n  Controls whether a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests,\nproviding some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks\n\nInline options are:\n\n  Strict: The browser sends the cookie only for same-site requests\n(that is, requests originating from the same site that set the\ncookie). If the request originated from a different URL than the\ncurrent one, no cookies with the SameSite=Strict attribute are sent.\n\n  Lax: The cookie is not sent on cross-site requests, such as calls\nto load images or frames, but is sent when a user is navigating to\nthe origin site from an external site (e.g. if following a link).\n  This is the default behavior if the SameSite attribute is not\nspecified.\n\n  None: The browser sends the cookie with both cross-site and\nsame-site requests. The Secure attribute must also be set when\nSameSite=None!\n\nNote: On Firefox 85, FireFox still doesn't have the Default set\nto SameSite=Lax. This can be changed via \"about:config\" and\n\"network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault\".\n\nTested: Webui-vue works. Redfish GUI browser works.\n        Websockets work on the GUI.\n        Tested GUI functions that call POST and PATCH.\n        Can see the XSRF-TOKEN and SESSION cookies are SameSite\n        Strict with this build. Before were SameSite None.\n        Browser DevTools -> Storage on Firefox to view cookies.\nSigned-off-by: Gunnar Mills <gmills@us.ibm.com>\n\nChange-Id: I4402f2930847c1d47b22696631be26d33c78b6f9\n",

You could just remove the header in the proxy and not require the xss option."
