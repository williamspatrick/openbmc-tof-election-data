It'd be nice if you guys got the PECI patchset into mainline, but I'm assuming that ship has sailed and you guys decided it wasn't worth it, so I'm kind of at an impasse as to what to do in regards to this handler.\n> > \n> > I think this may be why it's behind a build flag.\n> > \n> > Last I heard internally, we were preparing for another run at PECI, but I don't know the status.  However, even if we get PECI into mainline, I don't know that we can get crashdump into mainline.  Crashdump is the host app for these D-Bus interfaces, so that middle layer will still be missing from upstream. \ud83d\ude1e\n> > \n> > It's my goal at some point to figure out if it's possible to either make my application fit in the Dump interface that was recently added or make the Dump interface more generic so it can fit my application as well.  Until then, I can carry this implementation as a downstream patch if we need to remove this build path.  I guess that may be good to ask on the mailing list as well to make sure nobody else is using this build option...\n> \n> No response on the mailing list, so I don't think anyone else uses this or will be affected by this change.  Is it okay to keep the build option even though the backend components are not publicly available?  Or, should I move this out to a downstream patch for now?\n\nThanks for doing that, change looks good.  We can figure out the downstream/upstream thing in another context.  I'm hoping it gets solved with some  of the other stuff in-flight that are more pervasive than peci."
