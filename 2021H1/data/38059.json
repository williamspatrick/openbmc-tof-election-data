    "commitMessage": "This is intial POC for the cache based bmcweb changes\n\n   -> How we can cache the properties?\n   -> How the cache properties can be updated?\n\nThis POC is to get a feed back on the caching approach?\n\nAre we on right direction or should we change the\ndirection?\n\n- Create the Dbusinterface class which is the interface\nclass to invoke the Dbus opertiaon, The idea is to\ncreate the new function in the class for the opertaion like\nGetMangedObjects,GetSubtreepaths. which internaly creates the\nmatch object(properties changed) for all the managed objects\nor under the given root and ceates the match for interface added/\ninterface removed.\n\nOnce match gets hit the call back is called(notiFy handler) for the\nobject.\n\n-Create the data interface class which is to keep all the raw data\nfor the logentry(Bmcdump, SystemDump).\n\n- Data interface class uses the DbusInterface class for getting all the\n  manageed objects.\n\n- Callback gets called when there is any update on the Dbus object to update the\n   cached properties\n   -> Interface added/ removed/ Properties changed.\n\n- What needs to be done->\n   -  Update the map in the DbusInterface class when there is a user initiated\n     delete action.\n   - certian code is commented which needs to be corrected.\n\nThe aim was to get the feedback about the approach.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ratan Gupta <ratagupt@linux.vnet.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: Ie36824eefd0c3c7f2eb5e41f8c83b6ef7f09c693\n",
