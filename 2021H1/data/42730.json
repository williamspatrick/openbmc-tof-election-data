    "commitMessage": "Permit control of systemd-networkd IPv6AcceptRA configuration\n\nThe IPv6AcceptRA boolean is always set to \"false\". This effectively\nblocks IPv6 DHCP address assignment. There may be OpenBMC users that\nwill prefer this boolean to be \"true\" the first time the BMC boots.\n\nThis commit adds a compile time switch, that is added to the\nphosphor-network.bbappend file. Adding\nEXTRA_OECONF_append = \" --enable-ipv6-accept-ra=yes\"\nto the bbappend file changes the IPv6AcceptRA boolean in the network\nconfiguration file to \"true\". This does not overwrite the IPv6AcceptRA\nvalue present in a network configuration file that already exists. It\nonly assigns a value if the network configuration file is not present.\n\nTested:\n* Erased the entire SPI device, and programmed a new image with the\n  --enable-ipv6-accept-ra=yes. Confirmed that the IPv6AcceptRA value in\n  the NIC configuration file was \"true\".\n\n* Performed \"rm /etc/system/network/00-bmc-eth0.network\", and\n  rebooted. Confirmed that the IPv6AcceptRA value in the NIC\n  configuration file was \"true\".\n\n* Removed the --enable-ipv6-accept-ra from the bbappend file, rebuilt,\n  erased the entire SPI. Confirmed that the IPv6AcceptRA value in the\n  NIC configuration file was \"false\".\n\n* Performed \"rm /etc/system/network/00-bmc-eth0.network\", and\n  rebooted. Confirmed that the IPv6AcceptRA value in the NIC\n  configuration file was \"false\".\n\n* Rebooted in both test cases and confirmed the setting did not change\n  in the \".network\" file already present.\n\nChange-Id: Ieb6309ddcf2d003ed398e1c0c09bdee0670f6fcf\nSigned-off-by: Johnathan Mantey <johnathanx.mantey@intel.com>\n",

They consider it a a poor customer experience to have to manually enable every system that is being unboxed at a customer site to enable IPv6 Routing Advertisement.\nMy decision in creating this code was to leave existing behavior alone, while enabling vendors who want IPv6AcceptRA enabled at time zero to also have their wish."
