Tested configfile upload on a BMC where the base directory is not\navailable\n  2. Tested the configfile upload on a factory BMC. Verified it creates\n     the base directories and the upload is successful\n  3. Tested the configfile usecases for delete and delete-all\n  4. Tested the acquire-lock functionality\n  5.

For our work progress, can we please take this forward, and work on the meson install for the /var/lib/ path separately? Once that works, i will push another commit to remove the directory creation in this file."

The /var directory should be empty at build time, so we can\u2019t create any files or directories at build time, it can be done only at runtime. The /var is mounted to a read-write directory when the BMC boots up. Its not an overlay.\n\nThe changes to create directories at the application layer here are good."

The /var/ dir is mounted on a writable volume. If the content of a file doesn't change, it can be in the rootfs, if the content of a file has a default value and changes at runtime, it can go to /etc/ since it's an overlay. If contents are just created at runtime, the application targets /var/ at runtime, which is wiped out during bmc factory reset."
