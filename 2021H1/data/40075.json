End goal for us to create a single binary image that works for both daytonax and ethanolx.\nHence, I may have to reject some patches in the course of the review, if specifics for daytonax and ethanolx are not differentiated using a runtime mechanism such as DT overlay.\n\n\nJust a heads up that going forward, there wont be meta-ethanolx and meta-daytonax, it will just be meta-sp3, re-organization in progress and will be upstreamed soon. Hence, split your patches to help smooth re-organization.\n\nYour contributions are valued and appreciated."
