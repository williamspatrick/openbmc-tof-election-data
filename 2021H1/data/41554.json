    "commitMessage": "configs: rainier: Add virtual physical LEDs to Fault and Identify groups\n\nThese virtual physical LEDs are a mirror of real enclosure fault\nand enclosure Identify physical LEDs. However, these virtual LEDs\nare needed to be able to communicate the effective state of the\nenclosure fault and enclosure identify LEDs during lamp test.\n\nDuring lamp test, real physical enclosure fault and enclosure id\nLEDs should not be updated and they must be updated only after\nthe lamp test finishes. However, Hypervisors would need to know\nthe effective state of enclosure level fault and identify\nLEDs and that problem is resolved by these virtual LEDs.\n\nOnce the lamp test finishes, these virtual physical LEDs would again\nbe in sync with real enclosure fault and Identify LEDs.\n\nChange-Id: If7b658aeff73e87fd9c176c612b01b41996af5d5\nSigned-off-by: Vishwanatha Subbanna <vishwa@linux.vnet.ibm.com>\n",

But anyway, +1 :)\n\nThanks for the review. yes. it needs to be seen as one more physical LED.. for example: if we had 3 enclosure LEDs, then we would be in the same position. Did not want to codify the change since it can as well be controlled via config file. That way, will have one less ifdef."
