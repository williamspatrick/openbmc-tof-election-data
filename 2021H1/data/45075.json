    "commitMessage": "Changed event log paging to server side\n\nLogs where downloaded without any parameters,\nso api returned 1000 items. Paging was performed\non client side, and there was a problem when\nthere was more than 1000 log entries. There was no\nway to view them. Now paging is changed to server\nside, and we can view all entries. Filters,\nlocated above logs table filter data on client\nside. There was also a problem with calling logs\napi endpoint twice (once for Overview view, and\nonce for event logs view). This caused racing\nproblem and viewed\nunexpected data.\n\nSigned-off-by: Grzegorz Raguza <grzegorzx.raguza@intel.com>\nChange-Id: I615525e1009915d42268a40d868904809346da87\n",
