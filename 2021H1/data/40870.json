    "commitMessage": "regulators: Stop boot if cfg file not found/valid\n\nStop the boot during a BMC chassison/poweron if the regulators JSON\nconfiguration file cannot be found or is invalid.\n\nDuring the boot, the regulators application configures the voltage\nregulators in the system.  One of the most important voltage regulator\nsettings that can be changed is the output voltage.\n\nThe rules on how to configure the voltage regulators are defined in the\nJSON config file.  If this file cannot be found or is invalid, the\nvoltage regulators cannot be configured.\n\nThat would mean that the voltage regulators would be turned on during\nthe boot using their hardware default settings.  It is common for some\nof the hardware defaults to be incorrect, occasionally by a significant\namount.\n\nIf the hardware defaults are significantly off, it is possible that\nhardware damage could occur.  For example, if the output voltage is too\nhigh, downstream hardware components could be damaged.\n\nFor this reason, the boot needs to be stopped.  A critical error is\nlogged, and the executable run by the systemd service file exits with a\nnon-zero return code indicating failure.\n\nNote that this behavior will only occur if the phosphor-regulators\napplication is being used.  The application must be explicitly enabled\nusing a meson build option.\n\nTested:\n* Verified that boot is stopped if JSON config file not found/valid\n  * Verified critical error logged\n  * Verified regsctl exits with non-zero value causing config service to\n    fail\n* Verified that boot continues if JSON config file valid\n* Tested with both 'obmcutil chassison' and 'obmcutil poweron'\n* For complete test plan see\n  https://gist.github.com/smccarney/8801cad1fe1c4ae8913e57d9474bfaac\n\nSigned-off-by: Shawn McCarney <shawnmm@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I211f19cd9b98daea86645611633f8943c44b0f75\n",
