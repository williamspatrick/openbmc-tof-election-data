That's why calling the else section to destroy this connection.\nIncase of any errors, say like privilege check error, we would need to reply through the same connection without upgrading.\nSo, only unsuccessful messages needs to be communicated through this channel.\n\nEither ways, on success i.e. on upgrade, we wouldn't have this adaptor anymore to send the OK response."
