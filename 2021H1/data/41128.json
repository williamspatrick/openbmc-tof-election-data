Not everyone is using the github UI, and when we do docs reviews like this, it will need to be readable in text form, until someone figures out a better way to do markdown diffs in gerrit."

If you want to change the standard to not require 80 character widths, this code review is not the place to do it.  Feel free to propose a change to the docs directory, which contains the rules for this kind of thing, but I'm going to guess there's a number of vim and command line users that are going to disagree with you.

VuePress is a documentation tool and provides a great deal of formatting to make the documentation easy to consume. I realize that people consume in different ways and feel this solution can meet the needs of everyone. It will be a lower priority issue to resolve across all pages if it is a required change.\n\nI don't know what you mean by \"the github one\". If you are saying just using markdown in GitHub similar to the docs repo, we felt that the theming and formatting of documentation as browser based documentation was much easier to navigate and share expected patterns.\n\nhttps://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/#how-it-works"

Having different \"rules\" (if you can call them that) in different repos is counter productive to people that need to submit to multiple repos.  For example, if I were submitting here, I would've tested my change in the github UI, and pushed it, without ever realizing that VuePress was used.

If vuepress is really that much better, it should be easy to convince people that it should be used project-wide, not just here.  Barring that, consistency as a project is a good thing and should be prioritized over every repo having their own theming;  If only one repo of the docs are themed, and the rest aren't, it makes for a very messy experience overall.\n\nWith that said, you're the maintainer here, so it's up to you."

I'm all for documentation, but one of the big onboarding complaints is that we have no consistency, be it in software or documentation, and it's because when people push a new initiative (like vuepress, or webui-vue) they only do it for the new stuff, or in a portion of the codebase, and everything else gets left behind, and we end up with a worse experience, and no consensus that works for everyone.\n\nIt should be noted, when I've gone in the past, the GUI design workgroup routinely contains <5% of the developers on the project, so saying you got consensus on a general documentation style decision in that meeting is kinda hard to assume, and to reiterate, I don't think every sub-project should be inventing its own documentation style or theme, so I wouldn't expect this repo to be deviating from the base style.\n\nI've said my piece, and as I look further, this isn't the patchset that caused this problem, nor does it sounds like there's any desire to change it to the documentation style used everywhere else.  I don't mean to hold up this review because of this."

I would really hope that the same string translated to a different language wouldn't be dependent on which company wrote the change.\n\nIf IBM needs specific translations for IBM specific features, I would expect that to go under IBM specific feature flags.\n\n> - If another company changes the us file, the translation will no longer match\n\nYes.....  This is the advantage of an open source project.  When people add things, it helps everyone, and doesn't need explicit buy in from any company.\n\n> \n> > Also, what do the env variables do?

They are used for companies to be able to use a configuration to change the theme, navigation, and routing if they need something the rest of the community does not.\n\nIf they're not used for internationalization.... why are they mentioned in the internationalization document?

We do have a standard we follow when it comes to language and so far the community has agreed to the content that IBM has contributed.

I am not sure what to do about the translation files. Maybe each company translates on their own and translated files remain downstream only. IBM will send the English file for translation after code freeze before a release. The moment anything is changed in the English file the all the translated files are out of sync.

However, there is company specific copy out there and we still don't have a clear plan how that will be managed. No one has pushed back or even reviewed outside of IBM. We are trying to collaborate on this and resolve as much as possible to resolve downstream work, but there is a large number of variables to consider.

I am not sure how we are going to support some of these cases that are inevitably going to surface.\n\nSounds like a future design doc, but \"I need something specific and non-standard for my company\" I think should be separated from \"I need multi language support\".  The default should be to find consensus in openbmc where we can.\n\n> \n> \n> > > - If another company changes the us file, the translation will no longer match\n> > \n> > Yes.....  This is the advantage of an open source project.  When people add things, it helps everyone, and doesn't need explicit buy in from any company.\n> \n> This leads me to believe that the contributor that changes the language needs to be responsible for providing the translation for all supported languages impacted by their change?\n\nNo, I would expect only the languages they care about.  I'm not the maintainer here, but expecting every submitter to know every language seems a big constraining.  I would expect the submitter to make the accommodations for the default language (I'm assuming english) to prove that the code works, then those that care about the other languages can add the appropriate support.  Although, again, I'm not the maintainer here.\n\n> I am not sure what to do about the translation files. Maybe each company translates on their own and translated files remain downstream only.\n\nThis seems like a kinda odd policy, and at odds with collaboration.  In open source, I don't really want to speculate on your \"downstream\" that's your business, and has no bearing on what we do here.  For those that need the translations, upstream the various languages, and make sure there are reasonable fallbacks in place in code.  If the community thinks a language should be supported, it'll get a config file, if the community doesn't care, it will be incomplete.  If a language is incomplete to the point where it's not useful, it will be removed.\n\n> IBM will send the English file for translation after code freeze before a release. The moment anything is changed in the English file the all the translated files are out of sync. Have any thoughts on that?\n\nI see two paths here:\n\n1. Before allowing a new language in, make sure specific maintainers are assigned for each language in question, and set the expectation that they'll provide translations for new strings within X months of being checked into master, and ahead of releases.  If no maintainer presents themselves willing to do that, I would expect the new language to be barred from master.  FWIW, when we check in multiple languages of message registry into Redfish (as is allowed in the standard), this option will be my preference, where I am the maintainer.\n\n2. Alternatively, maintain feature flags for every conceivable option, and have cross reference checks between the required strings and the option itself, and only allow a language to be enabled if it's complete.  This seems hard to do given the level of detail you would need, but could also get you a result if you don't want to assign language maintainers.\n\nI personally think the first option is better, and more open source friendly, as anyone can upstream new definitions, and the code works as well as people care to make it.  It also conveys ownership to people, which I think is helpful.\n\n>  \n> \n> > > > Also, what do the env variables do?  How are they used?
