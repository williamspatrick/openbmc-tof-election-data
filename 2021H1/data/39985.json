    "commitMessage": "Add security flags to all phosphor builds\n\nYocto has a built-in class for applying compiler security flags to\nbuilds.  Some security concious projects within OpenBMC set these flags\nmanually.  We should do this project wide, given that it has a\nnegligible performance impact, and brings us in line with modern\nsecurity requirements.\n\nThere are some whitepapers on the specifics of what these flags do,\nwhich is a much better documentation than I am able to write here, but\nthe key takeaways are that this:\n1. Enables position independent code.\n2. Enables FORTIFY_SOURCE level 2.\n3. Enables -wformat and -wformat-security\n4. Enables strong stack protection.\n\nNone of these flags should have any change in functional behavior.\n\nSection 4.3 of this doc goes through this file in more detail:\nhttps://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/improving-embedded-linux-security-yocto3.pdf\n\ncroserver/eCMD doesn't currently compile with these flags, so it's\nexplicitly excluded for the moment.  Patchset has been merged against\neCMD master to fix this, but we're so far behind, the bump doesn't build\n\nobmc-libobmc-intf has an error that I can't quite understand yet about\nunused results, which shouldn't have been effected by this, yet it seems\nto be related to enabling the security hardening, so it is also excluded\nfrom the security flags for the moment.\n\nlibpldm includes an IBM OEM command that relies on undefined behavior with\nopen() the proposed fix is here, but libpldm is excluded until that is\nmerged and bumped.\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/pldm/+/3998412\n\nEven with those three exceptions, getting a majority of the security flags\nenabled on a majority of the repos should be an overall win.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: I0483b1dbe1123a7beff8c5788363685487fb9c09\n",
