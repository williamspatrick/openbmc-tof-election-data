    "commitMessage": "PEL: Handle location codes for connectors\n\nThere are cases where PELs need to callout physical system connectors,\nsuch as a USB or other cable connector.  This would be done by\nspecifying the connector's location code in either the message registry\nJSON or device callout JSON.  The problem is that the connector may not\nbe modeled by the inventory, and even if it was, there would need to be\na way to get the serial number, etc for the FRU that connector is on to\nuse in the callout\n\nInstead of forcing all connectors to be modeled in the inventory along\nwith a copy of the SN/FN/CC from the parent FRU just to do a callout,\nthis commit will just pop off the connector segment of the location\ncode, a '-Tx', before trying to expand it or getting its related\ninventory item.  That way, it will be operating on the parent FRU which\nwould be in the inventory with its SN/FN/CC.  In the case of the\nlocation code expansion, the connector segment will then just be\nre-appended afterwards.\n\nThis commit also makes a change to the device path callouts code to\nexpand the location code of the callout from the device path JSON\ninstead of trying to look it up later, which would have lost the\nconnector portion.\n\nNote that when a cable itself wants to be called out, there usually\nwould need be a symbolic FRU specified saying which cable it is, along\nwith the connector location codes.  In that case, the SN/FN/CC of the\nparent FRU would not show up in the PEL.\n\nChange-Id: I8e0eb58dfe630858f75e64b11ac13432bff4d2d1\n",
