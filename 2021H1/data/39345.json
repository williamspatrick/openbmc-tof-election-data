Is there something achieved by having a name \"PowerDistribution\"?  I don't think this is very common inventory type, so I can't really see any code triggering off of it.  If there is no code use case then it seems to me we should use a generic element (hence why I was suggesting Board)."

Board will always be represented somewhere, the only thing that's changing in this case is Item.Board is moving from redfish/v1/Chassis/<boardname> to /redfish/v1/Chassis/<mainchassis>/Assemblies/<boardname>\n\nWith that said, under the \"old\" (ie what openbmc currently implements) interpretation of the redfish spec, a PDB would become a Redfish Chassis, with ChassisType=Module.  That's not the best, and ideally we'd have assemblies, but we're not there yet.\n\n> \n> > And the power distribution fru is a riser card type.\n> > So can we have RiserCard interface instead of power distribution interface? this will be more generic.\n\n?  A power distribution board is different than a riser card;  It's confusing to me the fluid change in thoughts here.  Can you point to the device you're trying to model?  Is it both?\n\nA power distribution board tends to look like this:\nhttps://parts.metservers.com/00g8cn-dell-poweredge-r320-r420-power-distribution-board\n\nAnd a Riser card tends to look like this:\nhttps://www.itinstock.com/dell-poweredge-r320-r420-pci-express-x16-usb-riser-card-slot-2-488my-73505-p.asp\n\nIf we're going to break down the item interfaces to this level, they are very different things.\n\n> \n> Even RiserCard I don't fully understand the advantage of breaking it apart.
