    "commitMessage": "Automate PrivilegeRegistry to code\n\nThis commit attempts to automate the creation of our privileges\nstructures from the redfish privilege registry.  It accomplishes this by\nupdating parse_registries.py to also pull down the privilege registry\nfrom DMTF.\nThe script then generates privilege_registry.hpp, which include const\ndefines for all the privilege registry entries in the same format that\nthe Privileges struct accepts.  This allows new clients to simply\nreference the variable to these privilege structures, instead of having\nto manually (ie error pronely) put the privileges in themselves.\n\nThis commit updates all the routes.\n\nFor the moment, override and OEM schemas are not considered.  Today we\ndon't have any OEM-specific Redfish routes, so the existing ones inherit\ntheir parents schema.  Overrides have other issues, and are already\nincorrect as Redfish defines them.\n\nBinary size remains unchanged after this patchset.\n\nTested:\nRan redfish service validator\n\nRan test case from f9a6708c4c6490257e2eb6a8c04458f500902476 to ensure\nthat the new privileges constructor didn't cause us to regress the brace\nconstruction initializer.\n\nChecked binary size with:\ngzip -c\n$BBPATH/tmp/work/s7106-openbmc-linux-gnueabi/obmc-phosphor-image/1.0-r0/rootfs/usr/bin/bmcweb\n| wc -c\n1244048\n\n(tested on previous patchset)\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: Ideede3d5b39d50bffe7fe78a0848bdbc22ac387f\n",

OEM privileges I think we need to solve in the near future because we currently have OEM resources that would need this, custom privileges I think are a different patchset.  Unless this patchset conflicts with your goals in generating custom registries, lets keep the discussion of custom registries into a patch/design for custom privilege registries.\n\n> 1. The OEM creates a custom OEM_PrivilegeRegistry.json (and optionally (not recommended) edits their copy of Redfish_1.1.0_PrivilegeRegistry.json).\n\nI had imagined this would take the form of a json patch that we could apply ahead of time.\n\n> 2. The OEM runs the enhanced parse_registries.py script on their custom registries, and then merges their resulting custom copy of privilege_registry.hpp into their downstream repo or layer.\n\nI don't particularly care what anyone does in their downstream private repos, and we shouldn't be designing around it;  The code is open source, which means we can't dictate what downstream repos can and will do.

I'm assuming you mean meson?  That would obviously need to change, and the script that this commit is adding would need to be run at build time.\n\n> Will you please explain the development steps you foresee.\n\nFor each OEM schema we add, we would have a privilege registry json patch  RFC 6902, that we would apply to the registry before running the script.  I don't think anything would be included in meta layers, we would simply feature by feature apply json patches.  With that said, there's like 3 patches we need to sort out before that:\n\n1. How do we handle OEM schemas\n2. move the python script to build time instead of commit time and check in the privilege registry.\n3. Build the /redfish/v1/PrivilegeRegistry route\n\nTHEN, we can likely discuss custom privileges, because we'll have the infrastructure to deal with them.  Anything before that is just conjecture.\n\n> \n> I believe the basic approach for upstream would also work for my downstream needs, so agreed, we only need to discuss upstream.\n\nGreat, although it still doesn't matter in this context, as we're never going to write a \"here's the recommended way to fork the project\" document, nor support any stable APIs that facilitate making forking easier."

For example, it could create one called:  patchEthernetInterfacePrivilege_whenSubordinateTo_Manager_EthernetInterfaceCollection\n> - Then the code can name this alternate privilege set.\n> \n> Resource URI override\n> - I don't see any Resource URI overrides defined or in use.  If needed, these could be handled similarly to the subordinate overrides, with names like: patchSomeTypePrivilege_withURI_xyz\n\nSeems mostly reasonable.  I'm thinking we'll get this patchset in to solve the 90% case, then have another patchset where we can design the Override cases, and deal with the fact that we got some of them wrong."

This overload should be relatively safe to have now that line 437 is the same arrayness, so regardless of which overload we hit, we'll get the same behavior."
