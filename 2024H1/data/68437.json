The current eMMC implementation just blindly mounts over top `/var` which is broken anyhow but all they have to do is provide a phosphor-health-monitor config that uses /var instead of /run/initramfs/rw.\n\nEither way, I don't see this as affecting the bmcweb commit.

This patch took the approach of calling the daemon directly, which I think is fine in this case, but needs to handle \"path isn't there\" errors in a similar fashion to how we handle it in the mapper.  DBUS_USAGE.md documents all this intent.\n\n> \n> @Jagpal, I think you need to exame all of the `if (ec)` paths in your `after*` calls.  I don't think any of them should be returning internalError, but instead should be setting `jsonValue[...] = nullptr`.\n\nYep, we need to check for a specific kind of ec, similar to this:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/b5f288d294e17719f30e32acc40e07681baf04b9/redfish-core/include/utils/collection.hpp#L35\n\nAnd just return without populating anything.

In theory it's supposed to be producing fixed point values for any interface (ie 1.000), but considering almost no json library parses 1.000 differently than 1.0, the difference is moot in practice.\n\nFrom a user perspective (as both a dbus user and Redfish user) there's an expectation is that sensors (and any dbus double interface) know their precision, and don't publish things that amount to floating point division rounding errors, as that would show up on a user facing API.\n\nTemperature: 1.125\nIs different to a human compared to\nTemperature: 1.1250000000001\n\nIf things are producing the later, now bmcweb/the webui/any downstream client needs to make decisions about the value precision they want to display to users (as was done in this patch) that ideally would be handled upstream when the math is done, and we have more information about how many digits are available.\n\n\nFor this patchset, yes, bmcweb shouldn't be caring about precision.  It should be able to trust that the dbus daemon didn't produce floating point rounding issues."

                    "message": "> I doubt outside of dbus-sensors any of the other daemons explicitly round to some precision level.\n\nADCSensor explicitly rounds, because of the division math it's doing.  3 Decimal points wasn't really documented, but was based on the fact that the N bit 0-3.3V ADCs in the AST2500 were N bits (N is 12 or 14, I don't remember), so system voltages aren't going to have \"real\" precision beyond 3 digits.  (The math might actually say 4 for most use cases, hence why I say \"real\").  With all the added scale stuff added to ADCSensor over the years, the math could probably be made more accurate, but it's not off by a lot for servers with rails in the  0-12V range.\n\nMy recollection is that other sensors functionally end up rounded because of how they do their math on the hwmon interfaces (at least they used to).  Maybe that changed over time.\n\n> We know there is 2GB of memory total and if 1.5234512 GB are used, that is a real number.\n\nConsidering that the ManagerDiagnosticData/MemoryStatistics/TotalBytes definitions in schema are in integer bytes (Edm.Int64), not floating point (Edm.Decimal), the above is only an issue because this patch chose to implement the schema incorrectly.  Once it is appropriately setting them as integers (I'm assuming by flooring them to the closest int?), the problem you listed goes away.\n\nIt's unfortunate that dbus doesn't have a way to differentiate a floating point metric from a fixed point metric, but i'm not sure it's a huge issue.  static_cast<int64_t> isn't the end of the world, and should be right for most bmc use cases.\n\nSo as far as this patch goes can we agree that:\n\n0. This patch needs tested against service validator, as is documented in the developing guide.  Testing.md lists service validator specifically.  Ideally it wouldn't have been marked ready to review until that had been done, but it is what it is.  As always, happy to help if you have pre-test patches that you need help with, it just saves time if you mark things WIP that haven't been tested yet.\n\n1. This patchset needs to implement the Redfish schema properly for properties that are of type Edm.Int64.  I suspect this is going to mean calling static_cast<int64_t>(value) on the double for those specific properties.\n\n2. Seeing metric values on a user facing API that have floating point rounding (like in the example on the original patch) are at best messy looking to a human, and at worst downright wrong to the OData spec.  They should be corrected.... SOMEWHERE so they don't show up in a user facing interface.\n\nSeem reasonable?"

Some pretty small tweaks to the HealthMonitor dbus interface could've cut this down from 8 queries into one, by either implementing an ObjectManager interface for Metrics like we have for sensors, or making each value type its own interface name, so we could get them all with GetAll(\"<path>\", \"\")\n\nOh well.  This patchset is now functionally correct, so I can't see a reason to hold it up much longer.
