We need to come up with a solution to the binary size problem, as we can't just keep going down the road of adding new schema packs. Adding the whole pack made sense when OpenBMC implemented ~40% of the schemas provided, but now that we're only implementing ~5% of the schema pack, and redfish keeps expanding, installing the whole thing seems like a huge waste, and considering that equivalent binary-size-inducing patches that add less size have been held up because of the binary footprint, we should probably investigate that on this patchset as well."

                    "message": "> Ed has your thoughts changed?\n\nMy thoughts are essentially that I dislike Redfish doing this, and at some point we need to find a solution.  I've mitigated their problem a ton over the last few years by dropping size out of the bmcweb binary by optimizing/condensing actual code, a percent or two at a time.  Over the last few years I got the binary from 1.6ish MB down to ~850KB depending on what features you enable, but we're getting to the limits of diminishing returns on what can be done.  the binary is starting to get dwarfed by the schema pack.\n\nThat discussion is a different discussion than \"do we fix this bug\".  I think this patch should go in immediately.\n\n> we should probably investigate that on this patchset as well.\n\nThis patchset adds a trivial amount of binary size and is fixing a bug. Could we measure it?  Sure, but we can just look at the change and know that it's not adding that much, and if we wanted to not do this, the time to decide that was when we merged the patch adding usage of Protocol, not when we're fixing the bug in it.  I see no reason to hold THIS patchset up.\n\n> as we can't just keep going down the road of adding new schema packs.\n\nSome solutions I can think of:\n1. Provide an offline mode, where we just point the URLs back to the redfish schemas.  We need to come up with a way to differentiate our OEM from Redfish, and make sure the OEMs are still hosted on the BMC.\n2. Make the JSONSchema hosting optional.  This would drop about half the schema pack.\n3. Find a better way to compress the XML, possibly strip out descriptions, etc.  This could be done by storing the bare bones list of versions and properties, then generating the \"correct\" file on the fly.\n4. Engage DMTF with the problem, and make them produce a different schema pack, or start condensing old schema versions.\n5. Support multiple versions of the schema packs.  Systems low on space can use the old ones, systems with a lot of space can use the new ones.\n\nI might be in a position to go yell at the DMTF folks again soon if we want to do #4, but I'm open to any of them.  I have a really old patchset for #2 that never made it on master.  We kind of do #3 already with the json schemas, but we'd need to roll that into the CSDL (harder).  I've never looked at 5 or 1.\n\nOther ideas?"

Not all systems have a ton of flash, including some of IBMs (whitherspoon comes to mind).  Just because everyone (including me) have moved onto new better hardware doesn't mean we should be allowed to just break the build for a bunch of the old systems.  If we wanted to do something like a meson option for big-flash, little-flash, and have bmcweb make compile time decisions based on that, we could talk through what that looks like, but it hasn't really removed the complexity of maintaining this list.\n\nI kinda wonder if it might be time for Redfish to have an epoch event, and roll to V2, condense all the existing schemas (and maybe get rid of the CSDL entirely) and make some breaking protocol changes.\n\nAnywho, stream on consciousness a little above.  I still think this patch should merge as written."
