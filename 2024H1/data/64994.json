So it is easy;\n\nFor PCIe-DOE, not all PCIe device support DOE will support SPDM, we can't query about whether a DOE capable device support SPDM (to my knowledge). So it is easier to pass the pci bdf info to the daemon, so that we can directly do DOE discovery based on this info.\n\nAlso it is possible to provide PCI device id(VendorId:DeviceId) that we can use it to locate the device's BDF info and do DOE discovery from there.\n\nI'm open for suggestions on how we should support PCIe-DOE devices. So far, providing BDF seems to be the most straightforward one."

As a guideline, we don't check in code into bmcweb without both the interfaces present in PDI and a functional backend being available in OpenBMC.  Not requiring that in the past has caused significant thrash (see bifurcated virtual media implementations).  Happy to discuss if someone thinks there's a way to support a non-upstream backend, but the statement in the doc makes me think the order is incorrect, we should be approving an SPDM backend design first, then follow up with bmcweb which hopefully doesn't even need a design doc, because it's just following the normal DBus -> Redfish conversion rules.\n\nWith that said, this design lists unit tests (redfish service validator), and integration tests, so I'm a little surprised that this design doesn't include a backend, given that a backend would be required for any of the below to pass.  \"Design for SPDM Attestation D-Bus Daemon, demonstrating how to fetch the attestation results over D-Bus\" also would imply that this new daemon would require a repo?\n\nI suspect those two opposing things need clarified in the text of this commit.\n\nJust FYI to all, despite my name being listed as a contributor, I don't have a lot to do with the current implementation anymore, so I will leave it up to others to work through whether a repo is required and either updating the doc with that intent, or getting the repo request started with the TOF.  I'd note that the starter patchset of getting the schemas enabled is here:\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/61702\n\nFeel free to use that as a starting point, or do your own thing."

This way there's no specific support required for SPDM devices in the EM configuration schemas.\n\nI'd like to see this direction incorporated into the document."
