I actually need to update the 'tested' part of the commit, now that I look again. The latest commit of the code only creates one 'MAC' field instead of two now, and it's presented as a string displaying the hex values.\n\n>it is a separate binary but with a silly meaningless name\n\nI'll consider some potentially more meaningful names for this daemon.
