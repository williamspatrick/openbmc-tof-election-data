My thought process here is that pretty much all other alternatives that I ran through were worse than just a shared repo in OpenBMC.\n\nMy requirements are largely to put this somewhere that:\n1. Has an existing CI setup.\n2. Has an existing code contribution and leadership model for Apache2 software.\n3. Has coding standards we can code to.\n4. Is a recognized authority such that we can pull this into both an EDK2 build as well as an OpenBMC build.\n\nMy immediate thoughts for orgs were essentially this list:\n\nArm gitlab\ngithub.com/edtanous/libcper\ngithub.com/Nvidia/libcper\ngithub.com/DMTF\ngithub.com/tianocore/edk2\nlinux Kernel\n\nBut each of them fails at least one of the requirements above, except OpenBmc, hence why I landed on this design doc."

The requirement is that the code can be shared in EDK2, so if there's a way to make this code fit that requirement that isn't written in C, I didn't want to preclude it in the requirements.\n\n\nFull disclosure here, I'm part of the oreboot org, but I have no designs for trying to get this code shared with oreboot.\n\nThe intent behind oreboot is to use rust, so that seems incompatible at a library level with EDK2/OpenBMC.  If there's a way to write this design that includes oreboot, and there's interest from oreboot maintainers, we can certainly get this section amended."

I know there was a question of the base64 implementation, which has been replaced with yet another base64 implementation in the meson-dev branch that this doc will pull.\n\nMy intent once this is somewhere we can work on it is to either pull one of the existing single-file solutions already in openbmc to replace the hard dependency, or upstream the base64 recipe to open embedded.  Base64 decoding doesn't seem like the kind of thing that's worth taking a dependency on a library for such a small piece of code\n\nThe intent is not to add any recipes aside from libcper into meta-phosphor or openbmc/openbmc."
