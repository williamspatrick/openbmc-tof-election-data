There's only one other usage I could find, and that seems easier to me than trying to shoehorn a new type into Entity-manager when it was primarily designed to deal with strings.\n\n> Do you have any suggestions on how to represent the Datetime property type in a json file?\n\nI haven't looked at it in depth.  There are other keywords things that already exist in a generic form, we'd have to look into something."
