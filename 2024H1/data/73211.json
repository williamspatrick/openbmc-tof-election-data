This goes for `obmc-console-client` as well.\n\n> Also the code from the application cannot be re-used for the test.\n\nAs a maintainer of the code, for test cases like what I've demonstrated here, copy/paste isn't high on my list of concerns. It's fine. It's just test code. We can always rework it later if becomes a maintenance concern, which, as a maintainer of obmc-console, is my problem to fix given I'm asking you to create it. Please don't consider discarding the \"DRY\" principle a blocker to writing shell scripts for the tests.\n\n(A final nit is that the script is written for `sh` and not `bash`. It runs just fine in e.g. the [dash](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dash.1.html) shell, which is constrained to the POSIX shell specification. IMO `bash` has a lot of features that allow the implementation to creep into the territory of \"this should not be a shell script\", and should be avoided)."

Probably it did not work for me in this way because i never specified depends: [ server ],.\n\nIf you have questions about meson I'm happy to have a crack at answering them; but really all I have is experience with bashing my head against it. However, I do find I do less head-bashing with meson than say autotools. The meson documentation tends to be quite good, and the language itself tends to be pretty readable. We need to specify `depends` in this instance to make sure that `obmc-console-server` is actually built before we invoke it in the test...\n\n> Started implementing the tests in shell, for some reason some of them still fail in CI, but not when i run them in CI locally. Maybe i need to isolate them even more.\n\nI've looked into this (also based on your DM) and got it sorted; with PS2 `dbus-run-session meson test --repeat 500 -C build test-console-logs-to-file` completes successfully. I've made several small tweaks that you can see here:\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/obmc-console/+/73211/1..2/test/test-console-logs-to-file\n\nThe change that addresses the flakiness you found is to add:\n\n```\nwhile ! busctl status --user xyz.openbmc_project.Console.\"${TEST_NAME}\"; do sleep 1; done\n```\n\nI [used strace](https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/obmc-console/+/73308/1/test/meson.build) to understand what was going on. It turned out that while the `obmc-console-server` process had been forked off, in the failing cases it had either not yet `exec`ed from the subshell to the `obmc-console-server` image, or had, but had not completed initialisation before we hit it with `kill -s INT ...`. Essentially it was a lack of control over the scheduling. Ensuring that its initialisation has completed by testing for its presence on DBus lead to much higher reliability.\n\nAnother thing to note in the intra-patch diff is adding support for parallel instances on the one DBus session via `${$}` (the PID of the current shell process). This allows meson's `--repeat N` to behave correctly.\n\nThe final important difference is I got the test suite name wrong: It should be `itests` (plural) and not `itest` (singular).\n\nI haven't yet looked at your subsequent test implementations, but I expect you will need to account for these changes too."
