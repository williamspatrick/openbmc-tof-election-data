Please don't do that, updater daemon needs to own that behavior.  Bmcweb should make the request to update, with as much information as it has, then be done with it.  If the updater daemon wants to internally go get the SettingsD setting, it can do that as part of its flow.  The reason it does that flow is not because there was no dbus method call interface for it.  FWIW, that interface even predates bmcweb.\n\n\nAsking a different way, if I wanted to implement this same flow in IPMI, or another user-facing API, how would i do it without duplicating the \"Get the current setting\" code?  This is why the logic needs to go in the update daemon."

Maybe that assumption is faulty, but lets talk about that.  In the Redfish plugfests for firmware update, I don't think we saw anyone actually used this \"set the update time as a patch\" and most didn't implement it, which is why I'm considering just removing the flow, documenting that it's gone."
