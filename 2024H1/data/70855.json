If we had type alias in a single file then both contributer and reviewer job would have been easier. \n\nAll the call sites need to be reviewed for correctness, regardless of if it's a one line change or a many line change, the same as if you'd replaced the behavior of a function.  The more important part is that when reviewing new code, you don't have to remember which using matches to which documentation.  Having the base class be obvious makes it a lot easier to look up the docs.\n\n> \n> bmcweb is an application not a library.If worry is about the possibility of name collision ,that can be easily spotted and fixed in application. \n> \n> I still not convinced why bmcweb does not encourage type aliases for boost types.

This change itself is not changing the number of using declarations.  If you have a small example that you can show how this can make code better, feel free to send the patch, or start a discussion on discord or the mailing list."
