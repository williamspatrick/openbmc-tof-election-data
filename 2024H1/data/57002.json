By synchronous, I mean that no other users could interrupt/overwritet the message until completion. When HTMGT/HBRT sends PLDM_STATE_SET_OPERATIONAL_RUNNING_STATUS / PLDM_STATE_SET_OPERATIONAL_RUNNING_STATUS_IN_SERVICE, that message would get delivered to the BMC and if there was any communication error getting it there, would return an error to the caller. If the PLDM app on the BMC side got the message, that would probably be enough to say the message was delivered. The issues with the instance id reuse hopefully would also be resolved."
