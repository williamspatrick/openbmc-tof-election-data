I believe Terry Duncan maintains it these days (or should at least be able to point you to the right person).\n\nThat will get you a CI run, which should find a lot of the quick issues that CI can find.\n\nGiven that this is implementing a generic thing (Licenses) that is going to need to work across CPU and component vendors, this is probably the kind of thing that needs a design doc so we can get the implementation in place and the interfaces nailed down.  Ideally we would've done that before we wrote so much implementation, but no big deal, we'll work it out in the end.\n\n\nBased on the looks of it, this code was written a while ago, as I see a lot of the current best practices seem to be missed or were copied from old code.  In many cases I've pointed out only one instance, but there are multiple that need fixed, so please work through your code and fix all of them.\n\n\nAs an overall theme, this patchset needs to be using the mapper to find these license objects.  Calling a single daemon locks bmcweb into ONLY supporting CPU licenses, or maintaining a list of every possible daemon that can implement a license, so for that reason, we rely on the mapper to maintain a list of deamons for us, so please plan on porting your code to use that.\n\n\nIf you have any questions and want faster response times, Gunnar, Krzysztof, and myself are all active on discord (as are a bunch of other bmcweb users), and can help you out.\n\nAgain, glad to have you contributing!"

This patchset isn't the right place to discuss it.\n\n> \n> Last time we spoke, you had mentioned we can get the gerrit review to a merge-able point until Intel/AMI is ready other pieces.
