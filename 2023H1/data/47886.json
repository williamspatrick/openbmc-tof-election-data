I missed the fact that `inventoryItems` was also updated in those calls.\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/e8204933be90353ef672e62dc628448173279e1c/redfish-core/lib/sensors.hpp#L2230-L2239 \n\nAlso looks like the supply has dependencies on LED in https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/e8204933be90353ef672e62dc628448173279e1c/redfish-core/lib/sensors.hpp#L2464-L2501\n\nAfter looking at it in more details, it seems like the order dependencies are required for it to work.\n\nI'll try to see if there are other ways to refactor it. I was trying to see if we can move the powerSupply to not block getSensorData. Maybe have the powerSupply inject its data into it later, but it does not know where to add the information.\n\nMore time will be needed to resolve this."
