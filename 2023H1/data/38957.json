If I would wave a magic wand and have all the OEM schemas go away, I would.  I'm tempted to just delete/refactor all of them and just come up with the policy that OEM schemas have no API guarantees, but that's a different patchset, doc, and mailing list discussion that I'm not prepared for yet.\n\n> \n> The existing OEM schemas are excess code / schemas ( e.g. CrashDumps now with Dump support added to Redfish, could be modeled as non-OEM)\n\nYep.  Completely agree.\n\n> They have caused problems with updating schemas / running that script. https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/commit/2077899f6d4534d98ca2cca3bc9020dbc6a4aef9\n> All the reasons you list in https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/OEM_SCHEMAS.md apply to them. - Not standardized, lower quality of schema writing (there is errors in them), etc.\n\nWe're in complete agreement.

Schemas are not easy to write properly.  Feel free to reach out to the redfish DMTF committee for help, although if you catch me on discord, I can help you with the knowledge I do have.  Gunnar is also a good resource for this kind of thing.\n\n> Could you give me some help? thank you very much. What I want to achieve is:\n> \n>    \"Oem\": {\n>      \"@odata.type\": \"#OemComputerSystem.Oem\",\n>      \"IBM\": {\n>        \"@odata.type\": \"#OemComputerSystem.IBM\",\n>        \"LampTest\": false\n>      }\n\nUnderstood.  Your best bet would be to start reading through the redfish/odata documentation on how all these things work."

They provide direct access to the LEDs, and a simple looping over all indicator properties on all resources, and turning them all on from the client seems like a much better fit for the redfish API way of doing things, as it would also allow the client to verify that all components where the LEDs are expected exist.  The only thing that's missing then is the timeout, but that seems relatively easy to implement with Job service, as a stand alone item that would be started before the routine was done.  Unless I'm mistaken, that seems to fit well within the non-OEM redfish schemas.\n\nCan you add more details about why the existing redfish APIs wont' work as I've described?"

Well behaved Redfish clients already need to know how to walk the tree, and the logic is minimal (if component has an LED, set to ON).  Having all your LEDs enumerated in Redfish would give you 90% of the above.  I could see having an OEM resource for the LCD test, as that's pretty specific, but otherwise, I feel like there are resources to do what you're trying to do, it just requires that all the LEDs be enumerated in the tree, which is a good thing to have anyway.\n\n> Also, we can not achieve the above 4 functionalities if we offloaded that onto clients.\n\nYou can achieve 90% of the above, then have an OEM command for the last little part that's actually an OEM behavior.\n\nThe only other strange part is the timeout, but that seems easily modeled using task service.\n\n> This becomes challenging when we have more than 1 redfish clients.\n\nHaving an OEM resource seems more challenging, as now all redfish clients need to implement the OEM IBM only parameter, as well as detect whether or not the system is an IBM system, and fall back to the redfish defined behavior."

However, it's a feature that we want to contain in the server code for the reasons mentioned above. \n\nI've listed alternatives that don't require OEM properties, and implement what you want above.  Yes, it requires clients to be more complex, but given the cost burden of maintaining oem properties, it seems well worth it.\n\nAlso, considering the variety of LEDs you want to change that we don't even have them modeled in Redfish yet, I'd recommend that we need to model those first, before trying to add them to an OEM property.\n\n> Also, there are some one-off behaviors that we need to enforce on led-manager when the lamp test is happening. So, we can not rely on clients to do right thing for us.\n\nCan you give some examples of what these one-off behaviors are that you'd like to enforce?\n\n> We have gone over these in the phosphor-dbus-interfaces commit that I ended up abandoning.\n\nI will add it to my reading list, to see if I can understand your use cases better."
