But it exists and is relied upon by downstream forks so and I assume IntelCPUSensor maintainers would prefer to continue supporting it, hence I'm asking for the most practical way given the situation.\n\n> I think what Andrew suggested is simply to invert the logic here.\n\nSo with the patch as it currently is, the daemon tries opening /dev/peci-0 , and right there if it fails tries to continue doing a \"rescan\" in case it might be needed. The new code is above the old code and is run as soon as it's discovered /dev/peci-0 doesn't exist.\n\nI've just checked and indeed the old code doesn't have rescan at all (that surprised me), so I'll just check for it first, agreed.
