                    "message": "Having looked this over I think I was a bit hasty with the suggestion of creating a separate `dbus-handler.c`. When I made that suggestion I had oriented my thoughts around the means for the client to connect, rather than how the client's connection was integrated into the ring-buffer as a poller. Having thought about it some more I now think the latter is the most practical perspective.\n\nPrior to considering DBus as a method to connect to the console we had two handlers:\n\n1. The TTY handler for local-tty mirroring\n2. The abstract unix domain socket handler for client connections\n\nNow we're planning to add a third method, the DBus `Connect()` method, where the result of `Connect()` also provides a unix domain socket to the caller. In terms of the ring-buffer registration, whether a client connects via the abstract socket or the DBus interface doesn't matter, the outcome is the same: A new unix domain socket is registered as a ring-buffer poller.\n\nIt feels a bit odd to have this common unix domain socket handling live in `socket-handler.c` while both the rest of the `socket-handler.c` code and `dbus-handler.c` both call through that common infrastructure. The placement of this common code in `socket-handler.c` is just an artifact of history rather than justified by functional requirements and separation of concerns.\n\nInstead, I think we should make the primary concern be how the poller is integrated into the ring-buffer. As the result is the same whether connecting via the abstract listening socket or the DBus `Connect()` method, we should probably put the poller-related details of the `Connect()` implementation into `socket-handler.c` (i.e. shift the code currently in `dbus-handler.c` into `socket-handler.c`). That removes the need to expose the structs and functions above as their use will remain entirely contained in `socket-handler.c`."
