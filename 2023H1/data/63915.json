Is auditd usefule because it's owned by the kernel?  Is it that it's running as root?  It's non blocking?  It obeys some specification we're trying to meet?  That's not clear from the document.\n\nI would also ask that the folks review and update the LAST design doc that was published on this, rather than just writing a new one proposing a similar thing (or at the very least answer my comments on the last doc).  Publishing a new one just causes us to rehash the same conversations without context.\n\nOverall, there's probably a path to get this overall auditing feature on master, but my worries are:\n1. Duplication of logging code.\n2. Putting more dependencies directly in bmcweb, instead of rolling them out to another daemon.  Does the auditd logging calls provide non-blocking asio hooks, or are we putting blocking calls into bmcweb again (which has caused issues in the past)?  \n3. What does the Redfish implementation of this look like?  What's proposed below doesn't match up with the standard, and could use a good runthrough by someone with a good understanding of the spec.\n4. The requirements aren't written as requirements.\n5. How does this design apply to more than just redfish/bmcweb in the future?  Even if that's not an immediate requirement, it needs to be part of the design."

In your case you're adding auditd inside bmcweb but all other parts(ipmi,pldm,pam & etc) needs to be updated too to stick with this way. I don't think that is possible to make it just for bmcweb, in bmc a lot of places where you have to put those audit hooks.
