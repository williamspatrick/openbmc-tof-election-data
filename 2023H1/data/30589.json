Looking to add this so we can start considering changes needed for effectively managing redfish systems from a generic stance and finding API endpoints which are relevant."

It can be used for exploring the API to find where the different schemas live. This is more useful to folks like the xcat team who will be monitoring multiple products from different companies. Given the flexibility with schemas being in multiple places, this provides a method to dump, then find all locations for the schemas. A problem redfishtool needs to solve and we'll likely upstream this later"

If you aren't looking for those things, then sure, this is fine.\n\nAgreed, Not looking for support. Needed a tool to dump the redfish API, couldn't find anything readily made so I slapped this together. Formal integration into something could be done, but this provides a point to leap from, rather than starting from scratch. This would also be a piece of a 'collecting service data' function. Again, I couldn't find a tool to do this, and was asked to share this."
