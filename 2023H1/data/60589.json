But even then, it's not clear why some process other than bmcweb has to be generating JSON blobs. After reading the document again, I think it lacks any description of how nag hooks into the redfish data model and how we get the nag data out. I think perhaps we need to start there at the top and work our way to the bottom (where I was proposing the DBus interfaces above) rather than starting at the bottom and work our way up.\n\nWhat's requesting this data? How is it doing it? Can you provide example `curl` interactions with (potentially yet-to-be-implemented) redfish endpoints to describe what you had in mind?"

In the event that it's the reviewer who's position needs to be adjusted, you need to provide a reasoned argument in the document (not just reponses via review comments) to support that.\n\nTrust is the currency of open source projects. Proposing a design point and then subverting the reviewers by shifting the goalposts based on some internal agreement doesn't motivate anyone to continue reviewing your work. The perception that results here is that you're not interested in driving consensus on a broadly useful solution for the community, rather your interest is to push a minimal-effort, short-term hack that gives us on-going maintenance concerns through product-centric design.\n\nYou need to be comfortable with accepting changes to the design-point that require you to work outside your comfort zone. People are here both externally and internally to support you through that so long as you choose to put in the effort.\n\nIn my opinion, if you don't feel comfortable that, or with driving community consensus, then we need to find someone else who can champion this proposal."
