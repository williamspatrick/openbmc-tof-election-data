If someone wants to get the TOF to write up a policy change, filing something to be voted on is the wrong way to go about asking for them to write something up.  That repository is for voting and discussion once a change is concrete.  In that specific case, Nancy reached out to me, and I ended up writing the doc I wrote.\n</opinion>"
