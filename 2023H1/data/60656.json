Right now we don't a great way to verify if a param is supported by a satellite.  $expand for sure has issues so params that require making additional requests will probably see the same.\n\nWe don't have to strip any params if our handling code is able to detect that that operation has already occurred, or skip portions of the response that have been operated on.  To be safe for now we could block forwarding all schema defined params, but could that cause an issue with processing the params in the correct order if an OEM one should not be processed first?\n\n\n2. I think it's because that function is recursive so you end up parsing until you pass a json object that looks like\n{\n    \"@odata.id\": \"{Some_URI}\"\n}\n\nEven after expanding, the resulting json should still have links that fit that format at its lowest level.
