Security vulnerabilities add another avenue to this, because they essentially CAN'T be a two way door.  The minute a SEVERE vulnerability is injected, the project is at risk.\n\n\"action\" takes a lot of forms, and IMO, \"merge to master\" isn't the action we need to talk about.  I've seen \"bias for action\" used to justify drops in quality and maintainability, because \"action\" is required, and I think the bias for action framework alone misses a lot of the other leadership principles that keep it in check."

One thing I've coonsidered is flipping it on its head and putting the process up front and having the rationale follow it. That way people who just care about the process have it immediately available, but for those that care about it, the rationale is still there.\n\nThat said, the breadth and depth exists because the proposed process didn't emerge in a vacuum. The proposed process exists because I wrote down the background and thought about the impacts."

I'd honestly be sort of inclined to make it much more nebulous, maybe something like \"if a subproject's maintainers have been consistently unresponsive or excessively slow to respond for a period of at least ~3-6 months\".  The openness to interpretation of course leaves us potentially vulnerable to people being overly aggressive in petitioning the TOF, but my (optimistic, perhaps naively so) inclination would be to let people use their judgement -- if a particular individual becomes an excessively frequent complainant we can ask them to dial it back.  If we get flooded with complaints we can perhaps revisit the policy to raise the threshold for lodging one, but to hazard a guess I'd expect that complaints will likely remain infrequent enough that it wouldn't be problematic for the TOF to address them case by case, even if they don't all result in any actual maintainership changes."

I've experienced the behavior of a maintainer disappearing, finally getting their attention, and then they disappear again.  If all they have to say is \"see, I showed up once\" it kind of defeats the purpose of this whole process.\n\nI thought we'd discussed before something like:\n- period of inactivity results in a \"warning\".\n- some number of \"warnings\" results in us finding a new maintainer to add.\n\nThat's what I'm trying to make sure we're either covering as we want to, or being explicit that that's now how we're trying to operate."

So I suppose it's a matter of weighing that risk against the risk of people being too quick to escalate.\n\nPersonally I think I'd still lean toward a \"vague and flexible\" definition over a rigidly-defined one (we'll know if we hit the bad case because the signal is obvious, whereas it's harder to notice if people are silently having real trouble and not escalating)."

I think that's vague enough that there's some discretion there, but requires that someone establishes and defends the position that a pattern exists.

It should be easy enough for the complainant to make a claim about the existence of a pattern which is then established by the TOF as part of validation of the complaint. If the complainant wants to supply all the evidence as well, then that's a bonus (less work for TOF members)."

If maintainers are responsive enough not to fall afoul of the proposed cap of 3 consecutive months then really it's a matter of discussing onboarding others with them when they are responsive. If they're not engaging in that discussion in good faith that's when we may need to take further action. I think if maintainers are not engaging in the project in good faith it calls into question their continued presence in the community, which is a problem with broader scope than just their role as maintainer. Such behaviour is actively detrimental rather than just an inability to meet the community's need for progress.\n\nThe proposed 3 month cap is a bound to define it cannot be argued that you're not unresponsive as a maintainer, and justifies community action to mitigate it without further input as a means to avoid deadlock. In that context, taking action when people are even only intermittently responsive starts to feel like overreach."

If someone isn't willing to be relatively consistently responsive, they shouldn't give the impression that they are a \"maintainer\".  List yourself as a reviewer so you get informed and can provide feedback when you're able, but don't put yourself up as a block for others to get code merged."

While there is certainly value in sporadic engagement, having folks with authority, but no required responsibility can lead to deadlock as we've seen in the past, and is the point of this document.  Of course, there are likely arrangements among maintainers that can keep forward progress with overlapping responsibilities if maintainers need to \"go dark\" for a time, and can hand off responsibilities to others in an orderly fashion, and by my read, this policy doesn't preclude that arrangement, even if it doesn't explicitly call it out.  This doc only applies if someone has made a report that things are not happening an an orderly fashion."
