There was probably an attempt to \"fix\" the bug with the code that ended up in line 189 but it is similarly buggy.\n\nThe issue is that `spawn` is not required to start the co-routine immediately, but it can be deferred onto some task queue.  The local context (which contains `b`) can be destructed before that happens.\n\nThe code that ended up on line 189 attempted to fix this by making a copy before the first suspension point, but even that is an implementation detail that could easily be broken in the next version of Boost.  The `stdexec` library, for instance, doesn't ever run the co-routine immediately on spawn.  (Its task always uses https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/coroutine/suspend_always )"

In the case of callbacks, it makes sense to pass by rvalue reference, because we don't know the size of the callback.  While there could be a way to make message_t pass by rvalue reference as well, I don't think it's worth it, given that message_t is just a thin wrapper around a message pointer, it should be relatively cheap to copy."
