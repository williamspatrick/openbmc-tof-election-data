I'd also point out that this is a \"may\", not a \"shall\".  We arguably already have this rule, given that when people ask for new repos, we explicitly require them to call out who the maintainer is, so it seemed on par to me with the current status quo.  Maybe there's a rephrase that would make it more clear?"

I would say the intent here is to head off requests for merges of large features for which the submitter has no intent of maintaining it, or accepting community code changes for it.  Code that nobody uses or maintains is a burden.  There are a large number of repos that aren't enabled on any platform, and don't respond to review requests, that's what this is trying to avoid."

The other intent is to discourage the \"drive-by\" platform submissions that we've been seeing, and porting a platform almost certainly takes 3 months or longer.  Roughly half (stats needed) of the platforms we've ever accepted have had to be deleted eventually from lack of maintainership.  The other thing to keep in mind is that if there's a platform that can be done in less than 3 months, it's pretty trivial for one of the core maintainers to maintain it for a few months until the user gets their tenure (this has happened in the past).\n\nWith all that said, what change do you think we should make here?
