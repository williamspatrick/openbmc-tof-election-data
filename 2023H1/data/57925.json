In testing there were singular ones which were larger than the internal HTTP client's response buffer could handle.  It seems reasonable to expect the operator of the aggregating BMC to keep the BMC up to date so that the satellite BMCs are not using newer schema versions."

If it was somehow to reach aggregation handling then it would be handled like a \"normal\" collection such that the response from the satellite would be ignored because it's not of type application/json.

The path is enough to look up the schema via $metadata, which is what tools like redfish-service-validator does.\nI'm saying that when querying a satellite resource, there won't be anything added to \"@odata.type\" to indicate that the info is supposed to come from the $metadata of a satellite BMC.  Whatever entity can use the value of \"@odata.type\" to lookup the schema, but the result will be from the aggregating BMC instead of the satellite.\n\n\n> As a side comment, I'm not sure this policy is going to be able to survive very long.  I very much suspect that when we start to think through query param forwarding and cache forwarding, this is going to be important.\nYeah I'm getting that feeling as well.  I've maybe bumped up against this issue already in forwarding responses from satellite BMCs.  For valid response codes we only copy over the JSON response and use the aggregator's headers.  For invalid codes we copy over the entire message.  That's a potential issue since it includes the satellite's headers."

As part of aggregation, that will probably have to move to code, rather than generating it at compile time.\n\n>  If it was somehow to reach aggregation handling then it would be handled like a \"normal\" collection such that the response from the satellite would be ignored because it's not of type application/json.  It would've also been ignored because it doesn't contain the expected \"Members\" array.\n\nIt's also XML..... so yeah..... it's not going to be able to be parsed as json.\n\n> \n> \n> > > Even then, \"@odata.type\" doesn't include a full path so aggregation won't touch that field as part of aggregation.\n> > I'm not sure what this statement has to do with anything?  The path is enough to look up the schema via $metadata, which is what tools like redfish-service-validator does.\n> I'm saying that when querying a satellite resource, there won't be anything added to \"@odata.type\" to indicate that the info is supposed to come from the $metadata of a satellite BMC.\n\nCorrect, because as far as the caller is concerned, there is no \"satellite $metadata\".  It all gets aggregated.\n\n>  Whatever entity can use the value of \"@odata.type\" to lookup the schema, but the result will be from the aggregating BMC instead of the satellite.\n\nRight, but we need some way for the aggregating bmc to aggregate the schema files.  We punted on this originally, but we should probably document that assumption here, which is where my original comment was geared at.\n\n> \n> \n> > As a side comment, I'm not sure this policy is going to be able to survive very long.  I very much suspect that when we start to think through query param forwarding and cache forwarding, this is going to be important.\n> Yeah I'm getting that feeling as well.  I've maybe bumped up against this issue already in forwarding responses from satellite BMCs.  For valid response codes we only copy over the JSON response and use the aggregator's headers.  For invalid codes we copy over the entire message.  That's a potential issue since it includes the satellite's headers."

I've added an additional clarification for $metadata to the doc.  It's immediately after this portion on /redfish/v1/JsonSchemas.\n\nI'm going to mark this resolved, but please let me know if you think I should include additional information like the discussion from the link provided in Milton's comment.  I'm assuming we'll ultimately want to do something rather than make assumptions.  My preference is to not include talk of that until there's something more concrete, kinda like how there is list of specific features that must be implemented before we can turn on aggregation by default."
