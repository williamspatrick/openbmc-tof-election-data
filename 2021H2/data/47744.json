    "commitMessage": "fru-device: Add MUX channel name to FRU objects\n\nIf multiple FRUs of the same type are plugged into different channels\nof a i2c mux, it may be desirable to be able to identify them\nin a predictable way instead of with a dynamically assigned bus number.\n\nEntity manager supports channel name configuration for MUX device type.\nAdd a function to test if a FRU is behind a MUX and a channel name exists.\nIf the channel name is found, set MUX property to the channel name.\n\nNow $MUX can be added as a template in a FRU's configuration JSON file.\nThis gives identical inventory entities (FRUs) unique and meaningful\nnames. SOLUM_PSSF162202_PSU.json is modified to use this new feature.\n\nTested:\nRun on systems that have multiple PSUs connected to a I2C Mux.\n$MUX in config file is replaced with channel name for the mux.\nPSU connected without the mux, same objects are created as before.\n\nSigned-off-by: Zhikui Ren <zhikui.ren@intel.com>\nChange-Id: Ide804dfd56c34c73e8dcffc0eab818609fe1a69c\n",
