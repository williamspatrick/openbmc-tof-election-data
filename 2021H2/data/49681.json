    "commitMessage": "IpmbSensor:Add bus index for multiple IPMB channel\n\nIn multi host platform, IPMB bus channel will be different for each\nhost. Therefore, the bus index will be passed as an entity for each\nsensor from EM config file. \"Bus\" will be used as an entity for\nIPMB bus index.\n\nIn IpmbSensor, bus index will be read and specified bus will be used\nto read each sensor value.\n\nExample :\n        {\n            \"Address\": \"0x01\",\n            \"Bus\": \"$bus\",\n            \"Name\": \"Temp_Sensor\",\n            \"Type\": \"IpmbSensor\"\n        }\n\nTESTED: Tested on Facebook YosemiteV2 hardware for multi host\nIPMB bus.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jayashree Dhanapal <jayashree-d@hcl.com>\nChange-Id: I0a47057da98ee81471ac9f6fac69a036853db7d1\n",
