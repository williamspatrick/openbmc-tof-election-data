    "commitMessage": "HwmonTempSensor: Watch for InterfacesRemoved\n\nIn the current code, if a temperature sensor is on a removable card and\nthat card is removed, hwmontempsensor does not know it has been removed\nand will keep on trying to read the sensor, resulting in it reporting\nthe sensor is in error state (Value = NaN and\nOperationalStatus.Functional = false).  This isn't ideal because a) The\ndevice isn't in the system so why have a sensor for it and b) This error\nreading implies there is something wrong when there isn't.\n\nThis commit adds support to remove the sensor from D-Bus when its entity\nmanager configuration interface has been removed from D-Bus, which\nentity-manager will do when a currently passing probe statement no\nlonger passes.  This could happen, for example, when the EEPROM D-Bus\nproperty it was matching on is removed from D-Bus by the daemon that\nkeeps EEPROM contents on D-Bus when it detects the EEPROM is no longer\nthere.\n\nTested: The D-Bus sensor lifetime matches the entity-manager\nconfiguration object lifetime.\n\nSigned-off-by: Matt Spinler <spinler@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I2946e9adf8995abbfa977128a06a5eca84fb46f5\n",
