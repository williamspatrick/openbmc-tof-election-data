Therefore, the bus index will be passed as an entity for each\nsensor from EM config file. \"Bus\" will be used as an entity for\nIPMB bus index.\n\nIn IpmbSensor, bus index will be read and specified bus will be used\nto read each sensor value.\n\nExample :\n        {\n            \"Address\": \"0x01\",\n            \"Bus\": \"$bus\",\n            \"Name\": \"Temp_Sensor\",\n            \"Type\": \"IpmbSensor\"\n        }\n\nTESTED: Tested on Facebook YosemiteV2 hardware for multi host\nIPMB bus.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jayashree Dhanapal <jayashree-d@hcl.com>\nChange-Id: I6e1ab04891b81c115a2729c1c81cea1b0715d14c\n",

Looking at the patchsets, it isn't even really clear what you're trying to accomplish.  It looks largely like you're trying to circumvent the configuration system, which already knows how to do per-device-instance configuration parameters, so I'm really a bit confused why this is necessary, when a \"host\" in this case is basically the same thing as an add-in-card, which can already have multiple instances on a given system.\n\nPlease try to understand how dbus-sensors currently works.  the only thing that's done in compile time params is policies, which this is not.\n\nPS, asking how to do this on discord or the mailing list likely would've saved a lot of time.
