    "commitMessage": "development: deprecate tutorial on adding new system\n\nAs noted in openbmc/docs#68, the tutorial to add a new system is\nbecoming a bit outdated. It was never a full end to end doc to begin\nwith and it doesn't really fit well within a tutorial anyway.\n\nIdeally we as a community get a full blown document describing all the\ndifferent areas a user needs to update to add a new system.\n\nThis document still has some useful information within it so\nfor now remove it from the official tutorial README and add a\nnote to it that it is no longer officially supported.\n\nResolves openbmc/docs#68\n\nChange-Id: I16924b7991bc5e5a9111fdfd9a0bc18828ab4363\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Geissler <geissonator@yahoo.com>\n",
