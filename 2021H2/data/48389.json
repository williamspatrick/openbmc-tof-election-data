    "commitMessage": "reset-cause: define new pinhole reset gpio\n\nThe pinhole reset cause will be utilized by BMC firmware to know\nwhen it has been reset due to a user initiated pinhole reset. This\nis commonly done in error scenarios where the BMC is hanging or\notherwise unresponsive.\n\nInitially I put this under the Buttons section but as it's really more\nof a reason that a pinhole reset has occurred, I went with a new\nsection. The BMC is not involved with the actual pinhole reset hardware\nbecause the whole purpose of it is to trigger a BMC reset when the BMC\nis unresponsive.\n\nThe design doc on this function is at:\n  https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/docs/+/47816\n\nChange-Id: I9fb4e5909a279dc588815bb13ff1550c70f867ab\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Geissler <geissonator@yahoo.com>\n",

We're trying to define a class of things based on single instance of such a thing\n\nI think this is the crux of the issue. Either we try and define a pattern up front for a use case, so the initial one follows a rule, and follow on changes follow the same rule, or we end up where we are with \"reset\", no pattern. Chicken or Egg. I'd prefer a rule that only ever applies to a single GPIO name then not having a rule and getting bitten later when we find a common use case.\n\n> 2. Any input GPIO is an indicator\n\nYeah, valid point. I guess in the end this becomes somewhat of a last resort. It's not an LED, power, button, ....  But I am definitely up for whatever here.\n\n> For instance, is `-record` any better? I feel it might give a better translation of it capturing something that's happened in the past.\n\nYeah, I like that. The GPIO is giving a record of something that happened in the past.\n\nMilton\n> Are there plans to do more than a unique error log?\n\nIBM's plan is to create an info error indicating it occurred and to not run any automated power on recovery functions (i.e. if customer pin hole reset a system, they do not want firmware automatically powering the system on).\n\n> Ps where is the host status running gpio?  Ahh 47662  Not in a category, but an indicator as much as this one.\n\nYeah, interesting point, looks like https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/docs/+/47662/4/designs/device-tree-gpio-naming.md is going in a direction of just making a special category for host-ready. I'm not sure how well this review matches with that though. What we have in this review, is a GPIO that tells you why something happened in the past. The host status is more of a \"is the host running now\"."

One of Patrick's comments on a review about the code using this pin, is who gets priority (the sysfs watchdog reason interface or the GPIO) so there's definitely a certain amount of confusion that comes with having multiple ways to report why a reboot occurred.
