    "commitMessage": "Make fewer copies\n\nThere are apparently places where we make complete copies of the request\nstructure, including the body data within it.  Recently,\n59b98b2222fddbea3d6f678d9e94006521f0c381 came along and made the size of\nthe Request structure include the body payload.  This is good for object\nownership, but bad for code that wants to make a copy.\n\nThis commit tries to do something less insane, and construct the Payload\nobject (which only really includes the http headers, uri and method)\nbefore jumping into callback hell, thus meaning that the Payload object\nis copied 4 times instead of the Request object.\n\nTested:\nCode compiles.  Deleted the boost::beast::http::message copy\nconstructor, and observed that new code now compiles without needing a\ncopy.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: Ie81bade61fb1f6f392b163f98c84540e09a26690\n",

There's a size check in the connection handler.  If you try to write more than 30MB (or whatever the meson option is set to) the bmc will drop the connection.\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/596b203317f16ab624d374f811426a516912db25/http/http_connection.hpp#L42"
