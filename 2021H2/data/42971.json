For a truly dynamic addition someone will need to add a kernel driver.\n\nIf the goal of these entity manager patches is just to describe which bus its on then I'm ok with having it follow sysfs though the mux to find the i2c bus number assigned to the segment.

Once a port is selected for use other ports will not be selectable and thier devices won't be selectable.\n\nIf you are proposing dt overlays be loaded and its not upstream those should be moved to the alternatives considered.\n\nAs I've said, describeing a mux that is always presnt is always desirable; it appears this design adds some userspace tooling to entity manager to help describing cards that may be plugged in."
