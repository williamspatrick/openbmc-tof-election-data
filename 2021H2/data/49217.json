    "commitMessage": "Add trust bundle interface\n\nThe current certificate interface is for a single X.509 cert. We\nhave use case that there are hundreds of root certs and we don't\ncare about individual attributes in DBus. We only care about where\nto find the trust bundle and how to replace it with newer trust\nbundle. For applications that needs a root cert bundle, they can\nquery the path on dbus and load bundle from disk.\n\nInstead of managing hundreds of X.509 certificate object, we propose\nthis trust bundle interface.\n\nSigned-off-by: Nan Zhou <nanzhoumails@gmail.com>\nChange-Id: I1c45aa3f49ae9c727b244ae826b9804d85eb9fe3\n",

Can you contrast this new interface with the existing mechanisms that exist already?"
