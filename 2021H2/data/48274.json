    "commitMessage": "Logging: Event: Added the event_indicator association\n\n- The Redfish Status property is common to all the Redfish schema\n  that can also be used to represent the status or health of the self\n  resource (aka D-Bus object).\n\n- The Redfish Conditions property is one of the sub-property of\n  the Status property and that can contain the condition, or\n  the related resource information that affects the self resource\n  health.\n\n- But of course, there is a Redfish Status.HealthRollup property that\n  is already supported in the OpenBMC project to indicate the health\n  of the self resource if any of it dependent or related resource is\n  affects it and the Status.State property that can also be used to\n  indicate the state of the self resource but, these properties are\n  not explicitly tells \"Why the self resource health, health rollup,\n  and state are in the certain situation\".\n\n- For example,\n  - The Memory (aka DIMM) might be not functional due to its related\n    resource issues, and we may need to tell \"Why?\" is it because\n    of the association with another resource, which resource it is,\n    is there any error log to get more details?\n  - The user or system might be intentionally disabled or made as\n    unavailable, and we may need to tell \"Why?\" is it user or system,\n    what is the severity (may vary in different platforms), is there\n    any error log, is there the resource (aka entry object that\n    disabled or made as unavailable).\n\n- So, the BMC can use the Redfish Conditions property to tell \"Why?\"\n  the self resource health is affected by using\n  the sub-property of the Conditions property to give more details.\n\n  - To achieve that in the BMC, the implementor (who hosting\n    the Redfish resource aka D-Bus object) or another implementor (who\n    wants to maintain or monitor the health of resources) needs\n    the interface with required properties and associations so we can\n    use the existing Logging.Event (aka Conditions) interface and\n    the Redfish service provider can use these interface properties and\n    associations to convert as the Redfish Status.Conditions.\n\n  - The D-Bus service implementor can host the Logging.Event interface\n    instance with the added forward \"event_indicator\" association\n    and that association object_path can point the object (e.g. DIMM)\n    that wants the condition to represent the status.\n\n  - The Redfish service provider can use the D-Bus object reverse\n    \"event_log\" association endpoint to get the Logging.Event interface\n    instance and convert that into the Redfish Status.Conditions.\n\nD-Bus Mock-Up:\n\nLogging.Event interface instance:\n\n```\nbusctl -j get-property <event_service_name> \\\n       <event_service_dbus_root>/events/<type>/<id> \\\n       xyz.openbmc_project.Association.Definitions Associations\n{\n \"type\" : \"a(sss)\",\n \"data\" : [\n     [\n       \"event_indicator\",\n       \"event_log\",\n       \"/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/chassis/motherboard/dimmN\"\n     ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nForward association endpoint:\n\n```\nbusctl -j get-property xyz.openbmc_project.ObjectMapper \\\n       <event_service_dbus_root>/events/<type>/<id>/event_indicator \\\n       xyz.openbmc_project.Association endpoints\n{\n \"type\" : \"as\",\n \"data\" : [ \"/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/chassis/motherboard/dimmN\" ]\n}\n```\n\nReverse association endpoint:\n\n```\nbusctl -j get-property xyz.openbmc_project.ObjectMapper \\\n       /xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/chassis/motherboard/dimmN/event_log \\\n       xyz.openbmc_project.Association endpoints\n{\n \"type\" : \"as\",\n \"data\" : [ \"<event_service_dbus_root>/events/<type>/<id>\" ]\n}\n```\n\nReference:\n\n- Refer \"DSP2046_2021.2.pdf\" section 4.15 for the Redfish Status.Conditions.\n  https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP2046_2021.2.pdf\n\n- Refer below link for the OpenBMC HealthRollup design.\n  https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/redfish-health-rolllup.md\n\n- Refer below links for the \"Associations\"\n  - Design details:\n    https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/architecture/object-mapper.md#associations\n\n  - D-Bus interfaces details:\n    https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Association/Definitions.interface.yaml\n    https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Association.interface.yaml\n\nSigned-off-by: Ramesh Iyyar <rameshi1@in.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I6638bbc861e66feb3ec053ad97b6b27bcd576dc5\n",
