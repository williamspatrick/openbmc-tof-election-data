Not all platforms will want to support these six channels.\n\nWe have infrastructure to configure and describe the available virtual media channels already, which can also handle arbitrary data about those channels (for example, if you want to provide user-readable information - like whether they're CD or HDD types).\n\nThat's configured through the nbd-proxy's config.json; the \"metadata\" key in that json can be updated with whatever data you would like to describe the channels.\n\nThen, if you execute:\n\n    nbd-proxy --metadata\n\nyou'll get a small json fragment with the channel configurations - which, of course, includes the number of channels. I suggest you use that information to populate your channel datastructures here.\n\nIf course, you could read the underlying config.json directly if you prefer, but that includes more than just the metadata fields."
