    "commitMessage": "Make specific UNA sensors not trigger failsafe\n\nBy convention, sensors at some states like 'not present',\n'power state not matching' are marked as 'unavailable' on dbus.\nAt such states, some specific sensors should not be considered as\nfailed and trigger pid 'failsafe'.\n\nA typical example is when a system is powered-off, its CPU/DIMM temp\nsensors are 'unavailable', these sensors should not be treated as\n'failed' and trigger pid 'failsafe'. This is necessary for systems\nwhose Fans will keep working when the CPU is off.\n\nThis feature is configurable per sensor (valid on thermal sensors). It\ncan be enabled by setting the Pid controller option\n\"InputUnavailableAsFailed\" to 'false' when one configuring the PID module\nvia entity-manager, or by setting the sensor option \"unavailableAsFailed\"\nto 'false' when one configuring the PID module via JSON. (These options are\noptional and default to 'true')\n\nTested:\n1. On a Fan 'always-on' system, enabale this feature on CPU temp sensors,\npoweroff the system, 'unavailable' CPU temp sensors do not trigger the\nfailsafe mode.\n2. 'Unavailable' Fans still trigger the failsafe mode.\n3. 'Unfunctional' or 'failed' sensors still trigger the failsafe mode.\n\nSigned-off-by: Zheng Song <zheng.song@intel.com>\nChange-Id: I1dd1d76466f43e7dcf51c161c96714f1bcfae88d\n",

I've uploaded a new patch set which also includes the change of making this feature configurable.\n\nI'm now trying to update the unit test. Could you share some information on how do you build the unit test binaries with the devtool and test automatically? I tried to add the option '--enable-tests=yes' to the phosphor-pid-control_%.bbappend, but it did not generate the test binaries. I have to go into .../build/tmp/work/..../phosphor-pid-control/.../test to do a manually 'make check'. With this, the binaries were built but the following test can't be performed.\n'/bin/bash: ../test-driver: No such file or directory'"
