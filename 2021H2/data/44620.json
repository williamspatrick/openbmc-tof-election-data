    "commitMessage": "control:actions: Add timer based actions\n\nThe timer based actions action starts and stops a timer that runs a list\nof actions whenever the timer expires. The configured timer is set to\ncallback the list of actions against the given zones and any configured\ngroups.\n\nWhere any group does not have a configured value to be compared against,\nthe groups' service owned state is used to start/stop the timer. When\nany service providing a group member is not owned, the timer is started\nand if all memebers' services are owned, the timer is stopped.\n\nWhere all groups have a configured value to compare against, that will\nbe compared against all memebers within each group to start/stop the\ntimer. When all group members have a given value and it matches what's\nin the cache, the timer is started and if any do not match, the timer is\nstopped.\n\nBasic event config using this action:\n.\n.\n\"actions\": [\n  {\n  \"name\": \"call_actions_based_on_timer\",\n  \"timer\": {\n    \"interval\": 5000000,\n    \"type\": \"repeating\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n    \"name\": \"test\"\n    }\n  ]\n  }\n]\n\nChange-Id: Ibb80af3218b3cda8b1a7f5bc4dd31046ea6b2bea\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Barth <msbarth@us.ibm.com>\n",

(i.e. systemd restarts the ambient sensor service 3 times within Y-number of seconds, fans are set to 100% pwm after that service isnt on dbus for X seconds)\n\nAn example use case for using group values would be where a property is set on dbus, but additional time is needed before a fan control action should be performed.
