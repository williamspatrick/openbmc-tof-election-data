    "commitMessage": "Implement a test for patch compliance\n\nPer our documentation, patches outside of a couple specific directories\naren't allowed.  This commit implements a build-time check to see if any\nnew patches have been added.  Functionally, because there's several meta\nlayers that have broken the rules already, it has to contain a check\nagainst the various patches that already exist in the tree.  This list\ndoesn't constitute a grandfather-ing in of those patches, but recognizes\nthat we can't immediately back them out, and having the maintainers take\ncare of them will take time.\n\nOf note, this patchset also ignores patches in any of the poky layers,\nas we can't define their policies, and allows patches in meta-phosphor,\nas a backdoor in case we need a trapdoor to this policy, and all the\nmaintainers agree to it.\n\nThis change was originally checked into openbmc-build-scripts, but was\nmoved to support more users, and keeping this list up to date.  All\ncomments on the latest review from\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/openbmc-build-scripts/+/46064/2\nhave been addressed.\n\nChange-Id: I1c3e062278b4856cbfda910bdbf122e4b7539f89\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\n",

Essentially, we do parallel development of the DTS + schematics all the way to the first tape-out and then we usually have some changes between the first and second board revision.\n\nI'm worried about this churn in the DTS showing up in the kernel world.  Does it matter?  Are people going to be unhappy if we have multiple changes to the DTS in a week?"
