However, it does not use redfish.\n\nYes, I saw endpoints but in the comments above I noticed that there is also a redfish portal/documentation (mentioned by Ed Tanous). In my opinion if redfish is a separate website it should not use the authorization mechanisms of this webui. However I understand that this is some kind of shortcut (which also works in previous app). So, should I add a similar modification (like in: https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-webui/commit/09081ec7f06491150e90838a4bec53004358db51#diff-ae3386ffce819aa721dc9e50162c293fedad4d65019f4004d4b8b1f5c495eb3a)?"

Generally you do that by adjusting the window.location parameter, not the js route.  You could detect js routes, and fall back to window.location if the requested url is not a js route, but that seems like overkill.  Once you do that, you'll see the www.google.com example work too, which needs to be mitigated.\n> > > > \n> > > > Mateusz is no longer working on OpenBMC, so we will need to see who is going to pick up this story.\n> > > \n> > > Hello, \n> > > \n> > > Mateusz doesn't work with us anymore.
