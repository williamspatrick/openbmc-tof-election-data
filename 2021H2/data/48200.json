This commit moves to using the common\nimplementation, rather than duplicating the code.\n\nIn the course of writing this patchset, it looks like the definition in\nmetric_report_definition.hpp is incorrect, as we pulling metric reports\ninstead of pulling metric report definitions.  This commit has the same\nbehavior as the old, but will need to be looked at in the future.\n\nTested:\nBasic touch testing done by Szymon Dompke. \"Everything looks good to me\"\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: I643da1849aacc38848db1da3eeaad0c111521d34\n",

FWIW, coming up soon, we're going to be using a proper url class for constructing url segments, so removing the slash would likely need to change in the future anyway to support proper escaping.\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/48297"
