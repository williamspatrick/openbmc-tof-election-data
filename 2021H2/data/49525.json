If it is not set, the master branch will be\ndownloaded by default.\n\nSigned-off-by: George Liu <liuxiwei@inspur.com>\nChange-Id: I356e125e9b8381616fd302585e04c3792fa3fa8e\n",

We should probably avoid removing that feature because there might be users of it (does IBM use that internally?).\n\nMost of the non-openbmc repositories are fixed with a commit number, so it doesn't matter what branch they are on.  The openbmc repositories are all pointed at HEAD of ${branch}, which defaults to 'master' but can be overwritten globally for the reason I mentioned above."

The current {branch} is only used when we don't have a revision.\n\nSee:\n- https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc-build-scripts/blob/master/scripts/build-unit-test-docker#L423\n- https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc-build-scripts/blob/master/scripts/build-unit-test-docker#L438\n\nFor non-openbmc repositories we already specify a revision.  This can be a tag or a commit number.  In neither case does it matter what branch this commit is on; github just gives us the revision we ask for (it is quite common for projects to make tags that are not even on a branch!).  So your example of nlohmann, if we want a revision on the develop branch, we just add that revision to rev.  There is no need for adding a branch also.\n\nBoth the existing {branch} and your proposed change are only useful when we are consulting openbmc repositories where we are picking up HEAD.  For those, my understanding is that we want a consistent branch used for all of those repositories.  I can't currently conceive of a case where we'd want to add an explicit branch to an openbmc repository... so again, I'm not understanding the utility of your proposal."
