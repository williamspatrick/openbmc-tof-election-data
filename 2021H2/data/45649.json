So the message is present on real hardware in the log and is annoying and confusing (and it was surprisingly hard to get any clarification at all from you Intel folks here).

Should the error regarding the failed D-Bus call be emitted on systems which are not and will never be running the beep daemon? I'd say no.\n\n2. Should the error regarding the failed D-Bus call be emitted on your Intel system where the beep daemon should be always running? Guess this is up to you to decide.\n\n3. Should dbus-sensors contain any vendor-specific code like this at all? Probably not, and your beep daemon should instead subscribe to the relevant signals, and if some other functionality on some other platfrom needs handling PSU fail events then it would do the same rather than add yet another custom function to dbus-sensors.

Does this sound sane?\nOnce upstreamed, beep code manager will be available for everyone to take advantage of and it is not vendor specific. My initial thought is that I like the idea of having beepcode-manager to monitor interested events and worth investigate further.\nFor this patch, I still think, for right now, removing the error logging is a good alternative to removing the beepcode manager call altogether."

We do have this beep manager in our system, but I still don't understand, why it is mentioned in psusensor. Why not in adcsensor? Not in intrusionsensor? What if one would like blow up the server on intrusionsensor triggered - he should also add specific code to dbus-sensors sources?\nI would prefer to have in XXXsensor only code related to this sensors logic and all external reactors, like beeping and LED control too be subscribed for events.\n\nBTW, I also work on adding VRs to our system and I don't want server to beeps each time VR says something... It is even worse then error messages Paul speak about."
