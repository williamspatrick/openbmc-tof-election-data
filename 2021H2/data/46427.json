Were they just done for the sake of humans?\n\nCorrect, there's no user (kernel nor userspace) of the above descriptions.\n\nThere's no harm in them being part of the gpio-names array, but userspace won't be able to request them through the gpio interface as they are taken by the kernel driver.\n\n> I think this was strictly for the old fsi bitbang codepath.\n\nThere's no machines that use userspace bitbanging these days; everything is using some form of kernel driver."
