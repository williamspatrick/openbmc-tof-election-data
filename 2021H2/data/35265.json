    "commitMessage": "WIP: Enable HTTP redirects\n\nThis commit attempts to add the concept of an SSL detector from beast,\nand add the capability into bmcweb.  This allows directing multiple\nsocket files to the bmcweb instance, and bmcweb will automatically sort\nout whether or not they're SSL, and give the correct response.  This\nallows users to plug in erroneous urls like \"https://mybmc:80\" and they\nwill forward and work correctly.  This also means that https redirection\nis as easy as opening a second socket file to bmcweb on port 80.\n\nSome key design points:\nThe HTTP side of bmcweb implements the exact same http headers as the\nHTTPS side, with the exception of HSTS, which is explicitly disallowed.\nThis is for consistency and security.\nThe HTTP redirector ONLY redirects the GET and HEAD verbs.  This is\nbecause other routes are very likely to be sending credentials or data\nin the clear, and we want to make it clear that that's not acceptable.\nToday it returns 404 for other requests.\n\nThe above allows bmcweb builds to \"select\" the appropriate security\nposture (http, https, or both) for a given channel using the\nFileDescriptorName field within a socket file.  Items ending in:\nboth: Will support both HTTPS and HTTP redirect to HTTPS\nhttps: Will support HTTPS only\nhttp: will support HTTP only\n\nGiven the flexibility in bind statements, this allows administrators to\nsupport essentially any security posture they like.  The openbmc\ndefaults are:\nHTTPS + Redirect on both ports 443 and port 80 if http-redirect is\nenabled\n\nAnd HTTPS only if http-redirect is disabled.\n\nTested:\nPrevious commits ran the below tests.\nRan the server with http-redirect enabled.  Tried:\n\ncurl -vvvv --insecure --user root:0penBmc http://192.168.7.2/redfish/v1/Managers/bmc\n*   Trying 192.168.7.2:80...\n* Connected to 192.168.7.2 (192.168.7.2) port 80 (#0)\n* Server auth using Basic with user 'root'\n> GET /redfish/v1/Managers/bmc HTTP/1.1\n> Host: 192.168.7.2\n> Authorization: Basic cm9vdDowcGVuQm1j\n> User-Agent: curl/7.72.0\n> Accept: */*\n>\n* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse\n< HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n< Location: https://192.168.7.2\n< X-Frame-Options: DENY\n< Pragma: no-cache\n< Cache-Control: no-Store,no-Cache\n< X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n< X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n< Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' wss:\n< Date: Fri, 08 Jan 2021 01:43:49 GMT\n< Connection: close\n< Content-Length: 0\n<\n* Closing connection 0\n\nObserve above:\nwebserver returned 301 redirect.\nwebserver returned the appropriate security headers\nwebserver immediately closed the connection.\n\nThe same test above over https:// returns the values as expected\n\nLoaded the webui to test static file hosting.  Webui logs in and works\nas expected.\n\nUsed the scripts/websocket_test.py to verify that websockets work.\nSensors report as expected.\n\nChange-Id: Ib5733bbe5473fed6e0e27c56cdead0bffedf2993\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <ed@tanous.net>\n",

I'll ask the webui team to look at which URIs are redirected (see detailed comment below), to \"ensure it meets the needs of the user\". :-)\n\nAs I think about it more, I'm coming around to redirecting more than just \"/\".  It opens us to up a little more code that has to be trusted, but not a lot, and in theory if we obey CSRF, and not make substantive changes in GET requests, which is already required, we should be good.\n\nDid your webui team ever look at this?  Happy to have user input here."

That's not to say I question Miltons skills, but the tests there make me think that it hasn't had as rigorous of a testing as beast has.  Same goes for the URL parser.\nAlso, in that example, I see no mention of a timer, or body size limit, making it a great attack vector if someone is hoping to DOS attack the BMC.  We seem to be compiling regular expressions for each request?  That seems like a problem for the BMC startup times.\nMost importantly, the AWK approach is 592 lines of security-impacting code the project now has to maintain.  This patchset is a net negative line count, due to some of the continued housekeeping of http_connection, and simplifying a lot of assumptions.\n\nIn this implementation, we have essentially the same security model as bmcweb-secure, and rely on a parser that's been fuzzed and tested heavily, as well as rely on the same code we already have to get right in the secure case.\n\nWith all of the above said, I'm happy to be told I've missed something."

My point above was specifically about HTTP parsers when interacting directly to unauthenticated, possibly attacking clients.  It should be noted, I wish we could've used nginx, but the last time I prototyped it (a precursor to bmcweb), it was damn near impossible to write secure nginx plugins that did what OpenBMC needed.  I do get your point, we write a lot of openbmc-specific stuff, but my response wasn't intended to be a comment about the projects direction as a whole, simply that specific case, of a \"security conscious\" network API boundary, needed a lot of careful inspection.  We should strive to rely on as little openbmc code as we can in those situations.\n\nThis patchset is mostly using library functions, and wrapping them in the logic that OpenBMC needed to be compatible, hence why the patchset turned out to be 12 lines less than the old code.  I think that's a win for using things our libraries already provide instead of writing it ourselves.\n\nOne more note: I wish the telemetry service was a thin dbus wrapper around collectd with an rrd backend.  That would be ideal in my mind, and IMO openbmc has no unique requirements in that space that aren't covered already by that combo.  Unfortunately, I didn't write the current proposal.  Maybe I will if I have to review anymore MonitoringService code :-)\n\nphosphor-hwmon and dbus-sensors are both relatively thin wrappers around hwmon.  I wonder if you could rewrite them as thin wrappers around lm-sensors;  I never really considered that, but it would be neat.\n\nReading your response, I'm trying to understand, in the context of this patch, do you think the awk approach is better, and I should be testing, adding logic to, and hardening that one, or was it just that my comment struck a nerve?  Apologies if it's the later."

If I can help clarify anything, please, let me know, but most of the things I'm calling are from boost, and their documentation and reference is pretty good in most cases.\n\n> \n> It seems like there are some basic holes in hooking this up to the system, such as the socket unit file does not seem to link to the existing service files.

This patchset treats all sockets the same, which allows use cases like the one mentioned in the commit message.  Pinning a specific \"http\" and \"https\" port prevents forwarding on customized (non 443) ports.\n\n> \n> But there was also request for me to discuss the merits of performing the function in this server vs the approach of using my awk script, especially from a maintenance and security standpoint.\n> \n> 1.

However, I am not aware of any ongoing review of our library or monitoring the original upstream project for ongoing enhancements.  There is still the burden of having to review two implementations.\n\nWith respect, nearly all of the crow functionality has been replaced with boost at this point, because of the exact reason you mention.  Crow was not maintained well enough for the project to be able to rely on.  About the only thing left that's basically the same is the http router, which I do monitor the upstream project for changes, and occasionally backport things that we might need.  With that said, the last commit was 2017, so it's pretty easy to monitor.\nMy point was mostly that at this point, we have 0 maintenance of an http parser, and only really maintain the semantics of the connection, http routing table, and upgrade handlers, which we have to do regardless of what implementation we choose.\n\n> \n> 2.

The AWK implementation is good enough, and this is just duplicated effort/implementation that should be abandoned.\n2. The commit message needs cleaned up (see comments about systemd integration, I don't think it's incomplete), and the other small things sorted, then you would support this patchset being merged, and the awk script \"deprecated\" (not that we have a term for that as a project).\n3. This implementation and the awk script each have their own use cases, and each could/should be enabled depending on the user needs, and we should host both.\n\n\nThanks for reviewing this!"

It turns out that systemd has an API for grabbing the socket file name called sd_listen_fds_with_names.  I was intending on encoding an enum into the socket file name to try to denote what kind of channel the socket was.  \n> ... \n> > That would mean that administrators could have very fine grained control over EXACTLY what a given socket and port supported protocol wise, and would allow for extensions like binding unauthenticated http channels for \"in the box\" interfaces (like the host interface) that wouldn't require authentication.\n> \n> That sounds encouraging that the full control would be given addressing most of my concerns.   What is left is a review of what is allowed over http and I think that was readable.\n\nCurrent patchset does the above.  Full control is given on multiple socket files.  I think the current patchset should let admins configure exactly what they want, and sets us up for a path for redfish host iinterface."

This is mostly out of self interest, as the number of times I hear \"bmcweb isn't working\" and it turns out that they forgot to put \"https://\" at the front of their url is a very large number, and annoys me every time :)\n\nMy second use case for this was to clean up all the socket layer stuff so we can actually write unit tests in the future by injecting \"test socket\" types into the construction of the server.  We're getting close to that, but not quite there.\n\nI never really thought about Redfish, as I think at this point most Redfish implementations go straight to https (or are configured to do that).\n\nAs far as validating the validity of the redirect target, assuming it requires more than just a host check, doesn't that leak information about the platform without authentication?  I'd have to look into that more, but like I said above, Redfish is out of scope for this patch, but I'm happy to discuss what the right behavior should be.  Once we figure that out, it should be relatively trivial to code up.\n\nNo, Redfish metadata will not be available over http.  A man in the middle attack could possibly inject something nefarious into the metadata that either causes a redirect to an attacker site, or something else that would be bad."

This is the intent of service mgr (which I haven't really followed to see if it made it to mainline).  It is designed to be able to modify socket files to modify ports that services use.\n\nI think all 3 use cases are covered if we add a compile option.  The only part where this gets hairy is with the ENABLE_HTTPS flag.  That flag has been broken for a bit, so I'm wondering if nobody uses it anymore."

Unless the compiler is way smarter here than I give it credit for.  Now I'm curious what the behavior is for something like:\n\nmyNonTrivalType = std::move(myNonTrivialType);\n\nBecause that's essentially what's going on if I did it the way you wanted. \n I'll fully admit, I didn't try it that way, but it seems like it would be compiler-specific and brittle."

Notice how the logic here: https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/35265/45/http/http_connection.h#361 prevents the detection routine from even being run if HTTPS redirect support is disabled?  Are you looking for runtime support for adjusting that rather than compile time?  Does runtime modification of redirection work today in the awk stuff?  If so, I wasn't aware of it.\n\n> \n> Also,\n> | There isn't one.

I'll take a look and see if there's a way to make this more explicit."

I can definitely document some of our discussions.\n\n>  Its a bit more permissive in that an installation could not, say, allow the http and redirect from some IP addresses but block the port from others with an external firewall.  \n\nDo any of the existing systems do what you describe?  I don't see that as being difficult to add later, but is your use case hypothetical, or real?\nIt seems odd to block only redirects from a particular IP range?  You'd think you would want to block them in tandem.\n\n> \n> This would need to be well documented for this unusual behaviour, and should probably be reviewed by the security working group.\n\nI think it's already been brought up in the security working group.

The option of allowing a non-ssl build of bmcweb has been functionally un-buildable for some time.  If someone cares, we could certainly add it back in a similar fashion, and get it fixed to get the behavior that you expect in that case.\n\n>  What happens when a user sends a http request?

Do we call them \"advanced\" if they're in many examples in the std, I'm not sure, but bmcweb uses them in a lot of cases.  Now that we're on c++14, we could annotate the return type to make it more clear (ie \n\n[this](bool preverified, boost::asio::ssl::verify_context& ctx)->bool\n\nBut thusfar, we haven't been enforcing this in bmcweb/openbmc, as it is a new feature of the standard.\n\nIt should be noted, I personally dislike this lambda, given it's giant, and obfuscates intent, but I didn't write it.  Cleaning it up is outside the scope of this patch (but rest assured, will be cleaned up in a future patch).\n\n\n> But I don't see any returns that are not true either.  they are all just debug log hooks?\n\nThe return value determines whether or not we should fail the SSL handshake because of a failed client cert.  Because OpenBMC supports other, non Mutual TLS auth mechanisms, we can't completely close the connection if mtls auth fails.\n\nInterestingly, you've found a \"bug\" IMO.  See discussion here:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/openbmc/CACWQX80QSyf95+ibN24nwiAdNLCtdWOQdsgqaHvVbdEG9b8jbA@mail.gmail.com/\n\nThe fix mention has yet to be submitted to the tree by anyone (it's on my list).\n\nWith that said, this too is outside the scope of this patchset, this function wasn't changed, simply moved scopes (hence the changes in indent changes that you're seeing)."

If you ask for non-SSL, it politely (ie 307 redirect) points you to the SSL implementation.  If you ask for SSL, it just works.  \"requiring\" a particular port match a particular protocol would cause the example in the commit message, as well as non-standard ports to no longer forward correctly.  I've personally seen this behavior on commercial BMCs non-standard ports, and it's very annoying when you type in http://<mybmc>:4000 and the redirects fail to work."

If the client is using a non-standard port, yes, it would redirect them to use HTTPS on that non-standard port, which is I think the best we can do there (and is explicitly not functional on a lot of BMC implementations I know of).\n\n> \n> If not how does it decide which port to direct clients toward?\n\nIt doesn't, it either uses the browsers/clients preference (which forwards to 443 correctly) or, if the port is explicit, forwards to the same port, just using the SSL protocol."
