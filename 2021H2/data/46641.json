    "commitMessage": "mmc: Copy only LID files during update\n\nThis is one step closer in replacing the PNOR partition files with LID\nfiles:\n- During an update, only copy LID files to the read-write directory. The\n  update-bios-attr-table service will create symlinks from PNOR\n  partition files to LID files.\n- Use the pnor.toc from the read-only directory to get the list of\n  preserved partitions, since there won't be a pnor.toc file in the\n  read-write directory anymore. A future commit will read the PLDM file\n  table to determine which LID files to preserve.\n- Preserve the symlink target (LID file) instead of the symlink name\n  (partition file name), otherwise the symlink gets broken if we copy a\n  file that was a symlink.\n\nTested: Verified after code update that all the partition files were\nsymlinks to a LID file, and a subsequent update preserved the LID files\nthat correspond to the preserved partitions.\n\nChange-Id: I3fbe3de5a910d85c299ed7e5a535198283bd3f9a\n",

The only side effect is that the first code update will reset the preserved partitions."
