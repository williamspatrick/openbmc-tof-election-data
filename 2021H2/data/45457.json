    "commitMessage": "Remove patches against OpenBMC projects\n\nIt's not clear why these patches were added in this manner, but they\ncan't really remain here from a maintenance perspective.  Pinning one\nplatform on an old version of x86-power-control, as well as setting a\nspecific patch means that it's impossible for people to test and use\nupstream code with it.  It is also explicitly called out as item #1 on\nthe meta layer guidelines for this reason:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/meta-layer-guidelines.md\n\nTo the maintainters of this meta layer, please work with Jason and Kwin\n(the x86-power-control maintainers) to get your features accounted for\nin the normal build, adding build flags and configuration entries where\nappropriate.\n\nTested:\nThis almost certainly breaks power control on ethanolx, but given the\nway this patch was merged, there's really no way to avoid that.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <ed@tanous.net>\nChange-Id: I1f6a40e5b01c36441ff8d66e8e73265e0e009a4f\n",
