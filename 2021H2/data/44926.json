This one was wired to the BMC because a fault here would cause a bmc power loss/reboot.  Now in state manager when it detects it's coming back up when main power was previously up it can check this gpio and report a regulator error as opposed to a power blackout error: https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/+/44860\n\nI have no idea if this is common practice or not, though I imagine not."
