Each media instance\nused separate nbd device. Media image mounted and\nunmounted successfully.\n\n\nSigned-off-by: Dhines Kumar E <dhineskumare@ami.com>\nChange-Id: I8fc7b7bd34126c3c4c1bd17b43ef783a6e91c541\n",

Config.json file used to parse the which nbd device will be use for media redirection.\nExisting OpenBMC virtual media redirection can be redirect only one media instance, so that nbd0(/dev/nbd0) is using for virtual media device as per config.json.\n\nI just planning for extending the media instances redirection, so that from nbd0 to nbd5 is reserving for virtual media devices for 6 numbers of media instances.\n\nI guess virtual-media.json is for redfish virtual media redirection (legacy mode), Redfish virtual media will not use jsnbd. The way of redirection for proxy and legacy is totally different. So it is irrelevant comment."

Is this particular set expected to be a global configuration?\n\nIf so, I would suggest that you use more descriptive names, as there's no way for a consumer to distinguish between them."
