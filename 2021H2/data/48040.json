    "commitMessage": "Enhance management of DHCPv6 state\n\nKeeping track of the current state of DHCPv6 is not as straight\nforward as monitoring the systemd-networkd configuration file DCHP\nconfiguration line.\n\nThe following line in the systemd-networkd(5) man page describes\nDHCPv6 handling:\n\n'Note that DHCPv6 will by default be triggered by Router\nAdvertisement, if that is enabled, regardless of this parameter.'\n\nThus any time IPv6AcceptRA is enabled, so is DHCPv6. The\nsystemd-netword 'DHCP=' line may be set to 'ipv4' or to 'false', and\nDHCPv6 may still be active because IPv6AcceptRA is 'true'.\n\nThe changes in this commit work to keep the DHCP configuration\nexplicitly in sync with the state implied by IPv6AcceptRA.\n\nKeeping the state explicitly in sync aids with the IPMI Set LAN\nConfiguration, and Get LAN Configuration commands related to IPv6\naddresses. Specifically parameter 56, IP Static Addresses, and 59,\nIPv6 Dynamic Address. The IPMI commands use the D-Bus DHCP state to\nmake decisions on how to present address data. Presenting the DHCP\nstate accurately helps IPMI commands to present the network state\naccurately.\n\nTested:\nBooted System Under Test (SUT) with DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 enabled,\nincluding IPv6AcceptRA true. SUT has two NICs.\nConfirmed second NIC had valid IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\nSet LAN Conf 64 to turn off IPv6AcceptRA\nConfirmed D-Bus DHCP entry reports both IPv4/IPv6 are active because\nthe configuration file has 'DHCP=true' still.\nConfirmed NIC only had IPv4 address\nAssigned a static IPv6 address.\nConfirmed NIC has static IPv6 address assigned.\nConfirmed D-Bus DHCP state is IPv4.\nPerformed Get LAN 59, and the IPv6 address reported is ::/128\nPerformed Get LAN 56, and the static IPv6 address is displayed.\nSet LAN Conf 64 to turn on IPv6AcceptRA.\nConfirmed D-Bus DHCP entry reports both IPv4/IPv6.\nConfirmed DHCP assigned an IPv6 address, and removed the static\nassignment.\nPerformed Get LAN 59, and the DHCP IPv6 address is displayed.\nPerformed Get LAN 56, and the IPv6 address reported is ::/128\n\nChange-Id: Icd72ad931d82a1a94e821242b784ead1ebd630df\nSigned-off-by: Johnathan Mantey <johnathanx.mantey@intel.com>\n",

My observation concerning DCHP address assignment via the systemd.neworkd config file is:\n1. The [Network] DHCP entry only controls IPv4.\n2. IPv6 Stateless/Stateful DHCP is controlled with a combination of [Network] IPv6AcceptRA and [IPv6AcceptRA] DHCPv6Client\nFor example, I can set DHCP=false, leave IPv6AcceptRA=true/DHCPv6Client=true, and still acquire a Stateful IPv6 address.\nThe gatekeeper for IPv6 address assignment is IPv6AcceptRA, not the DHCP entry.\n\nBased on this I want to propose the following changes:\n\n1. Modify the phosphor-dbus-interfaces to be more abstract. I recommend the following settings:\ntrue: ipv4 DHCP and ipv6 stateful\ntruestateless: ipv4 DHCP and ipv6 stateless\nipv6stateful: ipv6 stateful mode only\nipv6stateless: ipv6 stateless mode only\nipv4: ipv4 dhcp only\nfalse: static address assignment\n\n2. Deprecate the D-Bus IPv6AcceptRA property\n\nUsing these D-Bus definitions allows all of the details of how to write the systemd-networkd configuration file to phosphor-network. It allows clients to ask for the mode they want the NIC to use without having to know implementation details (i.e. IPv6AcceptRA).\n\nUsing this model will allow us to deprecate the IPv6AccetpRA D-Bus interface. In hindsight this interface should not exist because it is an implementation detail of systemd-networkd that clients should not need to know about."

That issue has been discussed internally. The expectation is that an ad-hoc solution to work around the IPMI API limitation may not be accepted upstream. I'd like to get guidance from the maintainers concerning this implementation.\n\nIPMI can directly control enabling RA.\nIPMI can directly control enabling DHCP. It does not have independent control of IPv4 vs IPv6.\n\nThis lack of control leaves odd corner cases to handle implicitly. If I follow your suggestion and use IPMI to enable RA, yet leave DHCPv6Client == false, then IPv6 addrs don't get assigned. What mechanism should be used to assign DHCPv6Client == true? If such a mechanism existed in IPMI now, we could always assign DHCPv6Client == false, and then control the primary DHCP= entry per the rules that the existing code follows now.\n\nI see the following options:\n1. Leave the phosphor-network handling as-is prior to this commit, and don't support IPMI correctly announcing DHCPv6 state.\n2. Implement what I have submitted, and have an ad-hoc solution to the problem.\n3. Create an OEM extension to SetLan, GetLan that controls DHCPv6 explicitly. Which is basically an ad-hoc solution, just in a different repo (i.e. phoshpor-ipmi-host, or intel-ipmi-oem)."

It's pretty clear in the IPMI spec that they expect DHCPv6 to be a possible option when dynamic router control is enabled. Having it disabled should then disable DHCPv6 too.\n\nIt would be really nice to decouple DHCPv6 from the DHCPv4 settings in the lan config."
