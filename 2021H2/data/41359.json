Also, OpenBMC is moving towards https://github.com/openbmc/webui-vue for it's web ui (and where a lot of the Redfish support is going). To get this in Redfish, we'd need to propose a change to https://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/Manager.v1_11_0.json I assume. There's a \"LastResetTime\". Maybe we could add a \"LastResetReason\"? I added Gunnar as he's our web ui and Redfish expert.\n\nWith that said, if there's a strong argument for your platform to stay with the old REST api and webui, I don't see a reason we couldn't add this to D-Bus."

Please use it for sure.\n\nAs you said that OpenBMC is moving towards webui-vue, we know that and plan to use it in the future.\nHowever, lots of our customers want to know the last bmc reboot reason and they are using old REST API to development their upper layer application according our implementation, and they hope we can upstream this feature as soon as possible.\n\nInitially, we find the page \"Reboot BMC\" in webui seems suitable to add prefix \"last bmc reboot reason\" to \"reboot date/time\". Then we find that \"reboot date/time\" is using \"LastRebootTime\" this property from BMC.interface.yaml to implement it. Thus, we follow \"LastRebootTime\" naming to add new property \"LastRebootCause\" to implement this new request.\n\nAt this transaction stage, we still need your help to merge it that let customers can keep their upper layer application design. Meanwhile, we can also help to add this new feature through Redfish and tell customer that OpenBMC is moving towards new webui \"webui-vue\".\n\nFrom customer's point of view, OpenBMC with more compatibility to support this feature no matter using old or new API.\nThus, we really need your help to consider to merge it again. Thanks you.\n\nWe have provided README.md about this feature for our customers. Just for you refer it. Thanks you.\nhttps://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton#bmc-reboot-cause\n\nSincerely,\nTim"

If you don't have it locally anymore, you can cherry-pick from Gerrit locally and do the rebase.  Under the \"...\" menu in the upper-right there is a cherry-pick option which should give you enough information to formulate the commands locally.
