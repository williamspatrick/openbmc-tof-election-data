Using the newest SmartNic proposal as an example, which in theory has the latest best practices accounted for, this would require a smartnic (which in OpenBMC would have a type \"Board\") to be a Chassis per the mockups (see \"Card1\" and \"Card2\"), so I suspect we can't just indiscriminately say \"all boards are assemblies\".  MAYBE (this needs more thought) we could say that boards without sensors or thermal nodes should be assemblies?  But that starts to get into a weird distinction that we should document very clearly and have a good long term plan for."

I'm having a little trouble coming up with a definition other than \"dumb board\", or guidance on when to use each.  In theory, if the board had ANY sensor, firmware, or controllable system on it, it should be a chassis, otherwise, it's an assembly.  now the question is how to codify that.......\n\nmaybe some code in chassis that checks for the relevant associations to sensors/drives ect that would make the board \"smart\"?

A Redfish co-chair recently said \"a simple rack server, probably just has 1 chassis\".\n\nBut..... a smart nic can easily exist in a \"simple rack server\", in fact, most new servers are coming with some form of smart nic.  Fair that it's not a 180, but it's definitely not as cut and dry as I thought it was.\n\n> The mockups show this.

I think for \"non-trivial cards and devices\" (which it sounds like you have that use case  but we don't at this time) they are still advising chassis (Redfish must then assume a simple rack server probably doesn't have this use case).\n\nYep, Willys patches are essentially adding cards with non-trivial controllers on them.\n\n> \n> > maybe some code in chassis that checks for the relevant associations to sensors/drives ect that would make the board \"smart\"?

Any assemblies code would have to answer \"From dbus, what is an assembly, and what is a chassis?\"  I'm not sure how we'd get assemblies code in without that?\n\nConsidering that moving a bunch of stuff to chassis is already going to be an API breaking change, I'd really like to only do it once if we can."
