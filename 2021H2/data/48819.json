Once those issues\nare fixed, this seems like it would be worthwhile to have on master.\nIdeally before merging again we would run this through the \"run all\nbuilds\" CI job to ensure that we're not causing regressions.\n\nChange-Id: I0b7103e3123a3ce00eeb1ffdef50f702af89b019\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\n",

I don't think this was a disaster that it messed up everything and had to be reverted at anycost.\n\nI never used any of those words.  I definitely don't think this is a \"disaster\" or \"had to be reverted at anycost\".  I'm proposing one possible way to fix the regression, which took 5 minutes to write the patch for.  If there's a better way, I'm happy to see other patches.\n\n> \n> Honestly, I feel demoralized looking at this commit this morning. It would have been great if people would had spend time helping me test all the repo's & fix issues as this is community work & It benefits every repository in openbmc, rather than people spending their time to revert the code.\n\nI'm sorry you feel that way;  To be clear, I definitely don't want this revert to merge, but it took about a minute execute the git revert command and does fix the issues, so in terms of effort, it was significantly less than trying to triage the build issues.\n\nIt does help quite a bit that you've weighed in on https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/48802 in the meantime since this was originally pushed, so it's very possible that this revert isn't needed anymore if you have a solution.\n\nI don't personally have free time this week to be debugging this directly, and I did give my own suggestions on how it could be fixed.  To be clear, I think you misunderstood my statement above, I think this change is valuable, and would be good to have on master, so long as it doesn't regress anything that worked previously (ie local non jenkins builds).\n\n> \n> This is just my opinion, and i will not be scoring a -1 here , so that i cannot stop maintainers from merging this revert. But if maintainers of this repo agrees with Ed's reasoning please feel free to revert it.\n\nYep, this is entirely up to Andrew and I will defer to whatever his thinks is the right thing to do.  If he thinks triaging the issues directly is easier, I'm happy to defer."
