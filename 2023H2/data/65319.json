You've presented exposing all of rsyslog config onto dbus, which I don't really have an appetite for nor do I understand why you've gone this route.  This is what a design document is suppose to elaborate.\n\n- What are you solving?\n- How are you solving it?\n- What were the trade-offs that lead to this design?\n\nEven by giving me all of the code, without any design, you're asking me to reverse-engineer your requirements from your code.  ie. You're putting a burden on me (and others), the reviewers / maintainers, for something we likely don't have any care about.  The more work you put on us, the less likely you are to get your code in.\n\n> The bmcweb patch needs to be reworked as I used boost coroutines to get several DBus properties in sequence and then process them to check if a syslog server is configured or not.\n\nHaving a non-functional patch would at least give me something to look at.  Right now all I see is you've exposed the entire config on dbus and I have no idea why.  If I at least had the Redfish code here I could look up what schema you're trying to populate.\n\nYou do have a Redfish schema for this... right?  What is the schema?  I cannot believe DMTF would have exposed the entirety of rsyslog onto Redfish either."

First, through Redfish.\n2) At the moment there is no support for this functionality in openbmc.\n3) It is supported to set up a remote rsyslog server via DBus/REST (https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-logging#remote-logging-via-rsyslog). Rsyslog will send messages to the remote server using the syslog protocol. The default filter \"\\*.\\*\" is applied.\n4) Filter settings and remote server address (IP, port, transport protocol) live in one file (/etc/rsyslog.d/server.conf).\n\nSo, openbmc has a service (phosphor-rsyslog-conf) for setting the address of a remote syslog server by editing the config file. I want to add the ability to configure syslog filters in the same config file with this service. And then interact with the attributes/methods of the service via Redfish.\n\nI use the Redfish \"EventDestination\" schema. Since v1.9 EventDestination adds a \"SyslogFilters\" property.\nhttps://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP2046_2022.1.pdf\nhttps://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/Remote_and_Local_Syslog_05-2020-WIP.pdf\n\nbmcweb patch (doesn't compile.
