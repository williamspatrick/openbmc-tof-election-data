THEN we can can discuss what the code looks like.  please also write a commit message.\n\nI\u2019ve ready your mail to the mailing list, and I\u2019m not sure I even understand the problem you\u2019re trying to solve in regards to error handling.  we have error handling today that has been discussed in code review at length.  this patchset appears to completely change it, with no discussion of what existed previously, and ignores the Redfish spec in regards to error handling behavior, and chooses to instead implement something totally different and undocumented (setting null)."
