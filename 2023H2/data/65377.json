At time t (ms) pldmtool send GetPDR to get the first PDRs and get the response -> it has PDRs. Right after that it calls DBus interface to get next instanceId to get next PDR.\n\n3.

AF_MCTP sockets do not behave this way, therefore any work-arounds like you're proposing should go in the mctp-demux transport implementation, and not in generic code like you have here.\n\n2. If pldmtool successfully allocates an instance ID at step 5, then it must be the case that there's no in-flight request associated with that instance ID. As such, it must also be the case that draining the socket on entry to `pldm_transport_mctp_demux_recv()` is enough - any message that previously used that instance ID must already be enqueued in the socket, and can be removed prior to invoking `pldm_transport_send_msg()` to remove the ambiguity."

It will just never be the case that if the AF_MCTP transport is in use that anything needs to be drained. We can test whether or not anything needs to be drained using the `pldm_transport_poll()`. Something like:\n\n```\nfor (int i = 0; i <= PLDM_TID_MAX && pldm_transport_poll(transport, 0) == 1; i++) {\n    pldm_transport_recv_msg(...);\n    /* Discard the message */\n}\n```"

We can't be putting constraints, beyond the PLDM specification, on the behaviour of processes that are running concurrent to ours. Applications running concurrent to ours can continue sending messages as much as they wish (especially currently, given our violation of the spec with the lack of per-TID queuing), which we will keep receiving due to the behaviour of mctp-demux-daemon.\n\n> Because there is no guarantee that there are only 8196 messages which are not consumed by pldmtool\n\nIf you're going to state that then you're acknowledging that the do-while loop doesn't really have a bound.
