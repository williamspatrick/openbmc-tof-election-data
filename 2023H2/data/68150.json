You get a stable release that can be built at any time and doesn't break randomly because we pulled in a breaking change from a dependency.\n\nMy opinions here aren't strong, mostly because nlohmann seems to do a good job keeping old code building on new versions.  There are other dependencies (boost, libgpio) where I think the difference matters.\n\nWith that said, I do think this patch needs to switch to the nlohmann master branch.  The default branch is develop, which I don't think we want for subproject?  I'm assuming HEAD will just give us the newest on the default branch?  Or is it smart enough to grab master without it being specified?"

By default meson only extracts the package the first time you build and if you don't know what you're doing you can end up with a year-old git-commit anyhow (even if the wrap file changes, meson doesn't re-fetch).  \n\nI don't think we need to make 30+ commits to update the version for a developer aid.  If we end up where a particular version of nlohmann-json breaks, developers can `git checkout <good commit>` in their subprojects directory until we sort out what is going on.  \n\nTwo data points based on my ~2 years experience regularly leveraging subproject builds for development:\n    - Many maintainers don't even use it because I often find problems and have to fix them when making pervasive fixes (that touch their repositories).\n    - I've used this exact wrap file (or nearly similar, but HEAD being the important part) for a long while without issue.  Only about 4 repositories in the whole org have been using a pinned wrap file as-is.\n    \n> Or is it smart enough to grab master without it being specified?\n\nIt uses the default branch by default.  I don't see this as a serious constraint since we're not using this for CI (as described above)."
