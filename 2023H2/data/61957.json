You'd need to create a new daemon that puts the max sizes on dbus or you'd have to modify an existing daemon to add them.  If that's a direction you want to pursue then it should be a separate effort instead of part of this patch.\n\nI think it's possible, but what is the use case for something like that?  If you need a different max size then a compiler option seems like a more reasonable direction.

The method I'm adding follows the same flow as the existing one that retrieves a file from a file descriptor.  The only real differences are in the log messages, arbitrary max size, and the existing flow needs to base64 encode the file before returning it.\n\nThis actually comes up in another comment thread here https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/61957/comment/d857f491_63376a49/.
