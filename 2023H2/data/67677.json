Also, the ramoops dump will try to include a stack dump and the kernel log content nearby the panic.\n\nIf this was trying to create an entry for evey boot then logging intent to reboot might help disambiguation between panic, power loss, and intentionally reboot; however this commit is about saving ramoops in a sel and dump."
