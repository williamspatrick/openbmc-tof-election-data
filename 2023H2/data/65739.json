This doesn't seem accurate.  All i2c devices are pretty likely to share wrappers around libi2c.  What you're saying is also the opposite of what we've seen in dbus-sensors with regards to VRs, where the majority of code is common, and only the last few lines of the specific commands changes per device, while the transports retries, etc all remain the same.  How did you come to the conclusion that the per-device code would differ significantly?\n\n> as only shared piece will be the DBus interface which already reside in a common repository (phosphor-dbus-interfaces).

In theory it's pretty trivial to write the FD in, say 8k increments so we don't double count memory, but I don't see this as terribly important to this design, but an implementation detail.\n\nI suspect this needs to say \"Implementations need to implement appropriate memory limits to prevent parallel updates from running the bmc out of memory.\""

In the simplest case, lets take a power supply that supports PMBUS update, but requires no other commands run to that device while the update is in progress (as is pretty common), how would this interface prevent access to that device from, for example, dbus-sensors?  We likely can't stop ALL sensor scanning, because that would be a thermal problem for the server, so how would this interface know WHICH things to stop scanning?"

It also gives a clear path for supporting non-opensource updates (which, while not a primary focus of this project, is an unfortunate reality).\n\nI don't really think there is a lot of [code] overlap in update for the BMC, voltage regulators (i2c), NICs (pldm), and CPLDs (JTAG).  Do we really want all these different interfaces, and corresponding access libraries, needing to be linked into a single repository?  What happens if/when various CPLD vendors give us separate libraries for their special flavor of JTAG?\n\nMy opinion is that if the interface requires a lot of boiler-code that is copied around various repositories, we've failed in defining the interface.  Let's fix that (if it is a problem) rather than trying to cram everything into one big repo."

Wouldn't you prefer to go to one repo to find all of the supported devices for code update by the project vs. trying to find the random repo? Our documentation for repos in openbmc is bad. When the project started we focused on lots of small repos, which caused a lot of confusion IMO. We then started moving towards larger repos (converging on PDI, moving PEL's into logging, ...)."

This looks more like dbus-sensors or bmcweb, which centralize one function into a single repo.\n\n\nFWIW, because these are going to share a transport to whatever device (i2c, pldm, whatever) I would expect the implementations of each to go in the repo that deals with that transport to avoid duplicating code and dependencies.  (i2c devices in dbus-sensors, pldm in pldmd, etc).  To support things like stopping sensor scanning when firmware updates are in progress (as is required by a lot of devices), it helps a lot to have the implementation for a complete device in one daemon.\n\n\nI share Andrews concerns that:\n1. As written going to create a lot of new repositories, and the repo creation overhead today is still high, which will possibly limit the number of devices we can support.  Considering we're likely to support 10s if not 100s of devices, that number of repos doesn't seem wise.\n2. This is going to de-incentivize core maintainers to maintain firmware update as a whole, given that each repo will likely have different maintainers (if this isn't the plan, let me know).  This is what we've seen with the IPMI repos that are repo-per-oem.\n\nAlso, in the context of this doc, it doesn't seem wise to approve the creation of wildcard repos with no fixed bound or listed maintainers."

If it's proprietary, do whatever you want, and reuse/copy whatever transport code you'd like into a private daemon and maintain it.  For upstream, we should avoid copying code for similar transports.\n\n>  Typically this is related to custom silicon where there are not public data sheets.  It seems relatively straight-forward for us to come up with a design where they can drop-in their own repositories without having to modify bmcweb, etc.\n\nAgreed, and I think just having it on dbus supports that, so long as we're using the mapper to look up EM devices that support update.  It's basically the same as the sensor model, which seems to work (there's probably more downstream vendor-specific sensor code than there is upstream at this point)."

In order to continue to support this use case, we would need to add support to an additional OperationApplyTime. I suggest \"OnStartUpdateRequest\", where the image would be staged until the user issued a \"StartUpdate\" action via the SimpleUpdate command. This option is probably simpler and more flexible than \"AtMaintenanceWindowStart\" because it doesn't require to specify the time when the update should automatically start."
