Linux has extended this to store phandles (references to other nodes in the tree) in several defined properties (eg, linux,stdout-path vs stdout), and devicetree.org has extended its definition to be \"chosen by system firmware\".\nhttps://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/blob/main/source/chapter3-devicenodes.rst#chosen-node\n\nHowever, the information parsed in your board fixup is all hardware information and should be placed according to standard bindings.\nhttps://github.com/HewlettPackard/gxp-uboot/blob/5aa47dcfa086fdde8093baa55fa0586e5b0ef56d/board/hpe/gxp/gxp_board.c#L249\n\nmac_0 and mac_1 should be placed in the driver nodes as local-mac-address.  U-boot had code to set the eth<n>addr envionment variables to the associated device tree entries (which I expect may set mac-address).\n\nhttps://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/blob/main/source/chapter4-device-bindings.rst#local-mac-address-property\n\nSimilarly, there are standard properties for model and serial-number \nhttps://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/blob/main/source/chapter3-devicenodes.rst#root-node\nwhich should probably be assigned to the root node.   I don't know what the pca is but having a device node representing it with its part number and serial would be expected.  (Note: I just read Andrew's comment about the soc device generic driver, which makes sense for hardware registers).\n\nIf you want to expose the raw blobs with their crc consider something like a /firmware node or sub-node describing specific stores (roms / images)."

In a hypothetical world in which HPE systems still had their hardware ID data stored in the secure element but did so in the standard IPMI FRU format, I think the approach to take would be to create a means to plumb that data into the existing fru-device daemon.\n\nLooking at the other side, in another hypothetical in which HPE systems used the same proprietary data format they do but stored it in a standard I2C eeprom, I'd be inclined to just add some logic to fru-device to make it able to recognize and parse the alternate format -- in fact, while it's been a bit dormant for a while, I've actually made some efforts on that front previously (for a different format, obviously): https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/entity-manager/+/49341\n\nSo given the above, what I'm wondering is if we could just make fru-device handle it itself, without introducing any new daemons or the like.  I guess my open question would be:\n\n - Is the access channel to the secure element only available during the early boot phase, or can the HW ID data still be retrieved once Linux is up and running on the BMC?\n   - If the latter, would it be feasible to create a driver that would expose that data as a file in a way similar to how I2C eeprom data is exposed in sysfs?\n   - If the former, could we just have u-boot drop the entire blob into a designated FDT node?\n\n - Does the proprietary data format preclude having an open-source parser for it?"

(i.e. what's described in lines 46-47 of the current version of the doc)  What I meant was to just leave it in its original un-parsed binary form to pass it through to linux (and thus its userspace) and let a parser in fru-device extract the needed fields from that.\n\n> I think that's in their u-boot fork that transforms the data in the reserved memory into attributes in the devicetree.\n\nAh, yes, and looking back at lines 42-44 that would seem to imply that an open-source parser for the proprietary format is indeed OK."

What is it that prevents u-boot from accessing the secure element? How does the HPE bootloader talk to the secure element? Is it attached via I2C? SPI? 1W? A bunch of stuff here is unclear and I think that lack of clarity is preventing us from providing further feedback.\n\n> and uses a predetermined location in RAM to pass the data along for pickup by u-Boot code.\n>\n> The location in RAM is not protected, so there's no guarantee of the contents after u-Boot's stage finishes and the rest of the boot process begins (even though it theoretically should be unchanged in the short term).\n\nI'm going to poke at this claim a bit more. u-boot has the ability to reserve chunks of memory for various reasons. You can find a bunch of related code in https://github.com/HewlettPackard/gxp-uboot/blob/v2020.10-gxp-openbmc/common/board_f.c by searching `reserve_`. I think it's possible to make this all line up so we can expose the data to userspace under linux via reserved memory.\n\n> As my current understanding goes, we can reserve memory via u-Boot making modifications to the flat device-tree, but we can't define data to populate that memory space from there. \n\nBut if you define the reserved memory region as the region that's already populated by the HPE bootloader, then there's no need to populate it, as it's already populated. However, if for some reason they need to be different locations, then it should just be a `memcpy()`?"

It also incurs more ancillary book-keeping work if any adjustments are made (adding or removing at anything but the end of the list implies a bunch of renumbering of existing entries).  The markdown feature of allowing you to write just a plain `1.` on every entry and have \"real\" numbers assigned when rendered helps there, but then you kinda defeat the intended purpose here in that you lose the ability to usefully refer to item number N when looking at the un-rendered source (which for me anyway is a pretty large fraction of the time)."

Perhaps something like:\n\n> The proprietary, HPE-controlled bootblock firmware communicates with a secure element to retrieve portions of the platform vital product data (VPD). It uses a driver whose implementation is strictly license-controlled and cannot be publicly released. The open source portions of the boot chain must adapt to the bootblock's reserved memory ABI for providing the VPD from the secure element.\n\nAlso I think it's worth discussing the extent of the other data provided through this interface. I dug up what I think is the relevant code-path in your u-boot fork:\n\nhttps://github.com/HewlettPackard/gxp-uboot/blob/384fc0fef13dae9c1567c1f1a6cdac491e7e2b90/board/hpe/gxp/gxp_board.c#L211-L216\n\nSo it looks like the GXP and PCA (what's the PCA?) part number and serial number, NIC MAC addresses? Are there other properties too or is this the set?\n\nBecause, you can exploit the `mac-address` property from the `ethernet-controller` devicetree schema to deal with the MAC metadata:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/ethernet-controller.yaml?h=v6.7-rc5#n20\n\nAm I looking in the right place here?"
