Commit messages must always address *why* (and less so *how* unless specific trade-offs were made around the implementation details).\n\nHowever, we also have an opportunity to make a pretty significant leap to not require any DBus transactions at all to allocate an instance ID.

However, if we're looking to reduce latency here, we can skip the DBus entirely.\n\nAs of [7c1dc7ea0b3e (\"pldmd: move to libpldm instance ID alloc/free\")][1] we can use the libpldm APIs directly to acquire an appropriate instance ID. A rough sketch of the code is as follows (you'll need to add error handling and such):\n\n```\nstruct pldm_instance_db *db = NULL;\nplmd_instance_id_t iid;\n\npldm_instance_db_init_default(&db);\n...\npldm_instance_id_alloc(db, tid, &iid);\n...\n/* Do things with `iid` */\n...\npldm_instance_id_free(db, tid, iid);\n...\npldm_instance_db_destroy(db);\n```\n\nAnd that's it. No DBus at all for allocating an instance ID, and allocations are correctly coordinated across all processes on the system ([here's a blog post with more details on how it works][2]).\n\nIf we're going to change this code, I much prefer we fix it properly by removing access to the `pldmd`'s `GetInstanceId` DBus API entirely.

BMCs aren't fast - this is unnecessary overhead and every operation counts. More importantly this makes any test cases interfere with the instance ID database of the system the tests are being run on.\n\nI suggest the database instance be passed into the constructor here as a dependency via a reference or pointer. The database itself should be instantiated in `main()`, as this is where the choice of the DB configuration matters (global database vs test-specific). If the code structure doesn't support that then it suggests the code needs some refactoring such that it can.\n\nHere's pldmd's approach:\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/pldm/blob/master/pldmd/pldmd.cpp#L201-L203\n\nThe `InstanceIdDb` class wraps up the libpldm APIs:\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/pldm/blob/master/pldmd/instance_id.hpp#L21\n\nReturning to the point on test cases, they should be implemented using an instance ID database instantiated using `pldm_instance_db_init()`. This way we can provide a path to a test-specific (temporary) database file and prevent interference with the system's global instance ID database. The pldmd codebase has an example of a class that provides this behaviour:\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/pldm/blob/master/test/test_instance_id.hpp"
