You might want to set your gerrit to compare this patchset to master, not this patchset to its previous self."

I'm interested to know what your thoughts are here, but we should probably have that discussion on the mailing list or on discord, not on this patchset, unless this patchset is in direct opposition to what you're thinking."

Overall I think this is a good change, I'm just not sure how to get it in without breaking people.\n\nCan you not split your approach? Have the class that implements the composable approach inherit from the current sensor base class, then convert the specific sensors as separate, incremental patches? Then once you've completed the conversion as independent patches, do whatever cleanup you want to the new composable sensor class?"

I didn't think about just inventing a new class temporarily.  Glad I asked."

I'm not in love with this one, but this is no worse than it was before, and in normal use (putting a ThresholdTimer within a sensor instance) the lifetimes are correct, even if it's easy to get wrong if this were a generic thing.  It's ripe for improvement if you wanted to refactor it.\n\n> Especially when they are used in a lambda passed elsewhere. Do we guarantee Boost won't call it after the lifetime ends?\n\nYes, this is one of boost asios guarantees.  Some others are:\n1. All async operations callback handlers will be called exactly once per async_* call.\n2. On destruction of the underlying object, the callback will be called from the destructor with an \"operation aborted\" error message."

In PSUSensor, there were strange crashes/misbehaviors that would happen if the sensors were reloaded during the run, and this was because Boost was calling stale callbacks after their underlying objects had been destroyed.\n\nYep.  The root cause of this is that Sensor is destroyed in the wrong order, and because it owns callbacks on the super class, might get called back on memory that no longer exists.  Having Sensor as a member variable instead of an inherited class actually gives us some ability to fix this, although I suspect fixing the check_thresholds thing probably fixes a lot of stuff.\n\n> The workaround was to add weak_ptr that would stretch the lifetime if needed, and cleanly let the callback become a no-op once it realized that its underlying object had already been destroyed by the time it was called: https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/30763\n\nYep, I recall that fix.  IMO it's a bit of a bandaid, as the ownership model is still wrong, it's just no longer fatal with the weak_ptr stuff, and you're forcing shared ownership on some things that really don't need it.\n\nOnce this lands, looking at the ownership model is on my short list to go look at here."

Originally this code was something like\n\ngCpuSensors[sensorName] = std::make_unique<CPUSensor>....\n\nWhich is exactly what a sane person would write.  In practice, this caused a really bad bug, where on reconfigure events, dbus would see.\n\nSensor Foo added sensor.value interface\n\nThen later on a reconfigure\nSensor Foo added sensor.value interface\nSensor Foo removed sensor.value interface\n\n\nEven though the sensor is still alive, the second add happened before the first remove, so the mapper removes it, and the sensor disappears.\n\nTo combat this, James wrote the code on the left, which destroys the old object (thus sending the removed events) explicitly before creating the new object.  He only had to do this because him and I stared at the compiler for several hours, and couldn't figure out the syntax to do an in-place replace of an object, rather than a construct and a move.\n\nThe code below, is the code we couldn't figure out at the time (turns out it needed c++14).   While complicated, is simpler in execution, and does exactly what we want here, destroys the old sensor object if it exists, and constructs a new one, all in one step.\n\nAs far as why it needs to use tuple, that's a question for the standards committee.  I'm sure they had their reasons."

The answer to that is largely \"it doesn't\".\n\nIt DOES make the memory ownership model cleaner, and gives us more control over the destructor order which should be the start of some of this stuff becoming cleaner, but this patch isn't the end all be all of patches, and doesn't fix every possible issue, it mostly just sets us up for being able to simplify this stuff further, which will clean up some ownership issues between the sensor class and the super class.\n\nIf you're interested, I'm happy to hear more about your ideas here."

If you see something like\n\nsensors[sensorName] = nullptr;\nsensors.emplace(sensorName, Sensor{...{});\n\nThat was us trying to fix it.  Modern code should use emplace directly, and construct the new sensor in place, instead of constructing via std::move.\n\nIn theory objectmanager could detect this and prevent the signal from going out (or destroy the old interface before adding the new one) but I haven't looked at that.\n\n> What happens if another service comes along and uses object mapper to get managed objects before the old sensor instance get destructed?\n\nYou get the old interface behavior.  We've done our best in this code to try to avoid that problem by properly destroying the old objects before creating new ones with the same path.  There might still be outliers though."

What's interesting, is this code looks right\n\nOk, I see the real problem here.  InputDev is owned by AdcSensor, but is calling into sensorCommon.  in theory, if we move sensorCommon to be declared above inputDev in the .h file, that should clear this up.\n\n\nWith that said, i'll do that in another patch.  Thanks for helping test."
