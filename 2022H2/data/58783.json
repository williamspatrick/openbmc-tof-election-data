Readability suffers a lot; I often end up spending inordinate amounts of time tracking down just _what_ a given string somewhere really represents (dbus path?  sysfs path?  sensor name?  dbus interface name?  who knows?).\n\nAnother is the amount of duplication between sensor daemons.  A lot of them have chunks of code that are...say between 50% and 95% percent duplicated with another daemon (e.g. the various createSensors() functions).  Comparing them often turns up small discrepancies that make it hard to see what commonality could potentially be extracted and deduplicated; sometimes it seems like the differences might not actually be semantically significant, but it's often hard to tell (especially with the general code-readability challenges).\n\nGranted, neither of those are all that directly related to the problem at hand here, but it sorta seems like an attempt to seriously address any one of them would likely end up tangled in the others..."

Although there are common code for threshold/sensors/utils, there are still quite a log of duplicated/similar code in different deaemons.\nAnd some different daemons support different configs from json, that's a another problem.\n\nHopefully these could be addressed in future (if we have better unit test cases)."
