The section on CPLD is empty and the VR and BIC FW updates are not listed at all.  The only section which is completed is BIOS, which is a good first step on this.  \n\nI would also change the document title to indicate this is OCP_BIC_multi-host_OEM-BIOS_firmware-update_implementation (or something similar) so it is clear this is only referencing the BIC in general terms and is specific to how to perform BIOS firmware updates in a multi-host environment.  Once the BIOS updates are implemented, additional Design docs can be submitted to indicate how other types of FW updates can be performed, building on the base use case for this interface."

As a general rule, managing external controllers from more than one daemon leads to problems.  For example, while doing a firmware update, generally sensors should stop scanning to avoid conflicts and unintended errors.  Having that kind of interlocking between two daemons is error prone.\n\nI'm fine if this logic goes into the new daemon in dbus-sensors you're abstracting, or if you want this in a new repo, but splitting up control is IMO a bad idea."
