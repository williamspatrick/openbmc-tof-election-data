Everyone in the community can use these configs and scripts, which we will contribute to the openbmc_build_scripts repo, to set up GCB for their platform.\n\nGCB supports many features that current Jenkins based system supports:\n1. continuously release\n2. presubmit and put labels as feedbacks"

But I encourage you do some reword for the entire proposal.\n\nUpstream design is not converting your internal intern proposal to a different format. Internally, yes, it's for vendors and the current content is relevant. However, introducing GCB to OpenBMC is not for Google vendors, it's for the community. It's providing an alternative to the current Jenkins based OpenBMC CI system. \n\nThink about the following questions, and write them explicitly in the doc,\n\n1. What's the real problem we want solve? hint: we are working on **CI**.\n\n2. What does current OpenBMC CI consist of? what features does it support? hint: OpenBMC Ci is based on Jenkins.\n\n3. Why GCB? Is it providing the supported features that current OpenBMC CI Infra provides? Is GCB better? hint: you can research on how GCB advertises itself.\n\n4. Why is Google hiring an intern to do this? How does getting codes into upstream help Google? hint: Google vendors can contribute codes directly; and think about why open source helps. \n\n5. What does Yocto based firmware builds require; how is that different on OpenBMC from Google internal builds? hint: read Yocto's document and understand what the repo you cloned really means."

I suspect that a design doc approval alone won't be enough to allow or disallow cloudbuild into the project, and its inclusion into openbmc-build-scripts is going to depend heavily on:\n1. How invasive the code changes it needs to make are.\n2. If the maintainers are willing to maintain it (and if not, if he's willing to let someone else maintain a portion of the build scripts that contain gcb).\n3. If the measured impacts to the obvious performance metrics (build time, SLA ect) are compelling enough to be worth the cost of the switch.\n4. If the \"Open\" part of openbmc can be maintained, while still allowing gcb support.\n\nAs an experiment, and line of engineering, this sounds very interesting, and something that's worth pursuing.  I don't think any of the maintainers can answer any of the above questions without seeing a series of patchsets, so my recommendation would be to start working.  Try to determine the refactorings and cleanups that need to happen that are irrelevant to enabling cloudbuild, and get those pushed first in your series, then get a basic prototype working, and we can evaluate the above from there.\n\n\nOverall, I think having more options for heterogeneity in build-server use is a good thing, not bad, and we should encourage it to the point that the complexity and maintainability will allow it.\n\nOne thing that isn't made clear in this design doc, but should be;  At this point Google has no plans that I'm aware of for removing the non-gcb Jenkins CI resources that we currently donate to the project.  If gcb turns out to be a compelling option for any of the important metrics, there's an obvious path for us to convert how we donate to the project in the form of gcb resources instead of direct compute, but that will be a much bigger discussion, and has to encompass the best needs for the project.\n\n\nOverall, good stuff, lets see some good results."

I would like Simon to answer most of your questions. \n\nI can provide some high level context: this is a 3-month intern project, and what is scoped is providing an alternative CI for \"on demand BMC releases\" only. The main target users for Google are Google's vendors. It's unlikely we will replace Jenkins in this time period. Instead, if we can finish the GCB configuration, get an E2E workflow demoed, push PRs to openbmc-build-scripts, and get them reviewed at the end of the internship, that's a solid start of the upstream GCB story, and it also fulfills our internal use cases. Google team and vendors will maintain the contributed codes."

This is a super interesting line of research, and we should keep looking into it, but I think discord is probably a better forum for talking about individual changes, given that nobody on this doc is going to be able to approve that level of scope, so I would get on the #infrastruture channel, and start sending PRs for the things you need to do, and you can talk with the CI maintainers there when individual things come up that you'd like to refactor in openbmc-build-scripts.  I suspect the abstraction of the separation is going to be important in those discussions.\n\n\n> push PRs to openbmc-build-scripts, and get them reviewed at the end of the internship,\n\nI'm sure you know this, but it's worth reiterating, don't push all your reviews at the end of the internship.  Make incremental progress over time in a series of patchsets submitted as you work, keeping the maintainers in the loop.  That will get you the best result."

I don't see how this review can get merged by upstream maintainers in the timeframe you're looking for.  There's too many technical questions unanswered to say whether or not this kind of design would be accepted, and those questions would largely only be answered by patchsets showing utility and abstractions in backing resources, not design docs.\n\nI also just realized that the CI maintainer (Geissler) wasn't even CCed on this review;  Considering that he's the one that would likely be approving any code-level changes to ci or openbmc-build-scripts, it seems important that he is included in the design."
