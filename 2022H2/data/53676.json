You could probably make an argument that it should also be included in this inventory design.  But, the simple answer is that Chassis more obviously speaks to \"containment\" and the major point of contention in that design is how we represent \"containment\" (with paths or associations).\n\nSlot -> Device is probably also a containment relationship but it wasn't as obvious as the Chassis discussion we've had a few times over so I let it go through.  Depending on the direction the design arrives at we might want to deprecate that association and get it cleaned out."
