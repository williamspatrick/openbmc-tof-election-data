It initially sounded a lot like the Evil Bit from RFC 3514.\n\nIt seems like we're going to end up having almost all of our daemons setting this, if we go this direction.  The manpage says:\n\n       sd_bus_set_trusted() sets the \"trusted\" state on the bus object. If\n       true, all connections on the bus are trusted and access to all\n       privileged and unprivileged methods is granted. This function must be\n       called before the bus is started.\n\nEffectively this setting goes around the SD_BUS_VTABLE_UNPRIVILEGED setting on methods and properties.  Should we instead change sdbuspp to add support for privileged / unprivileged settings and default to unprivileged?  We could similarly change the vtable code in this repository in order to make the ASIO daemons get this flag by default as well.\n\nI feel like if we go down this direction we're going to have to change every daemon to have this setting and every daemon is just going to blindly set it.  It will make it so that we are unable to have privileged methods in the future."
