I'd like to isolate the D-Bus proposal to its own section and make it clear from the outset that it's a short-term work-around to address some short-falls of the demux-daemon and the lack of the kernel-based socket interface."

Note: Our ultimate goal is to come back to Socket, but we are not going to start with that, considering a standard way for device advertisement etc. Once the MCTP is moved to driver based logic and standard way is defined for socket based advertisement, we will fall back to socket based approach (Note: we are still not going to start with driver based MCTP code). Plan is to have wrapper library also to do proper switching in the application like PLDM / SPDM etc. This is captured in the document.\n\nNote: In reality sd-bus still uses socket based D-Bus / kdbus in the backend. The advantage what the demux usage brings is peer to peer communication, similar to any other direct IPC mechanism."

This will give you a very easy transition later.\n\nOur logic is based on multiple instances of daemon (we don't want to run one daemon for all our physical medium interfaces, our plan is to execute one for PCIe and one for SMBus, but both must send / receive MCTP messages with Objects discovered etc, so that upper layer application like PLDM / SPDM will be able to query everything). We also don't want to come & interfere in the socket based structure, as we want to support independent network and Topmost bus owner logic. So, Even the existing socket based implementation itself may require change when we want to implement the socket in a standard way (Currently it is defined as a private structure etc), Any change there will affect all our applications. We are planning to use wrapper library so that when needed the switch can be done in easier form. \n\nNote: We want to use the libmctp stack, but not planning to use the de-mux daemon, and instead follow the D-Bus daemon path. The upper application like PLDM can have the wrapper layer. Both this approach can co-exist, and we can decide based on practical data.\n\nLet me know whether you will be able to join OpenBMC PMCI WG (which happens every monday), if timing is not convenient probably can sync with you over a separate meeting, or one meeting can bring your timezone friendly."
