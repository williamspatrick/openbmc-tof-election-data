This means:\n1. as long as the main host is booted, the whole machine is considered as booted/up.\n2. the rest of the hosts can be booted in parallel of the main host or after the main host is up. If the main host needs to wait for the other hosts before it's considered as up, the time will be counted in the userspace stage.\n3. the breakdown durations of other hosts are stored in durations, which is very flexible to store any data.\n4. the stage time covers only the contributors to wall clock time in a boot flow. In other words, we treat the boot flow as a linear flow of stages in order to have a meaningful breakdown of total boot time.\n\nFor scenarios of two or more main hosts, there are two possible solutions.\n1. only treat one of them as the main host, only the main management host is the main host. (this will be what I explained above)\n2. store and repot the data of all the hosts separately. (this needs a few implementation change to identify the host but the doc design should be very similar)\n\nFeel free to comments on the ideas. Multi-host is quite a new concept."

In terms of _implementation_ you can certainly start with the single-host case first, but in terms of design, we need to think about it here so we don't box ourselves into a corner.

So, we don't need to change our IPMI command design to support sending host ID from the host side. WDYT?\n\n?  I don't understand this statement.  Any IPMI command we add would need to be aware of what host you're asking for the data from.\n\n> What's the current plan for identifying/mapping data from different hosts for other components?\n\nThere are already components that do this today using dbus, and patches in review for others.\n\n> \n> I was talking about some hypothetical situation.

Thus, there will be synchronization event somewhere in user service or other places. There will be a main node that is responsible to respond to connections and distribute the tasks to other hosts. Once a connection is ready, the client can transfer data to sub-hosts directly.\n\nAt a manageability level, this doesn't really affect the BMC if there are software orchestration layers for the hosts.  We just see them as hosts, each with an independent state.\n\n> \n> It's not a common model for most multi-hosts machines. It's a more specialized design.

All the hosts are equal and power on simultaneously. In this case all the hosts will be treated the same (This should be what you expected).\n2. `main`/`sub` hosts. For example:\nIf the server uses a smartNIC which has a linux kernel in it. Then this smartNIC can be treated as a host. However this `smartNIC host` has to be fully power-on within the `loader` stage in `main host`. In this case either treating the `smartNIC host` as a host or not is fine.

Current design is the same as you said.\n\nDuring the host boot up, the only thing that host needs to tell BMC is \"I reached this point\", \"I reached that point\". That's the purpose of `Notify` command.\n\nThe command `SetDuration` is for additional/extra durations (It's optional)\nFor example, we may initiate the smart NIC during the `Loader` stage and we want to track how long it takes as well.\nIn that case the host can utilize `SetDuration` command to tell BMC: \"Help me to report this timing info to DBus\". So that other BMC Daemons can use it.\n\nFor the purpose of last command `SetRebootType` is that BMC can't distinguish the host reboot is `Halt` or `Reboot` by itself. So we need host to told us.
