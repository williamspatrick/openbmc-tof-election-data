Having this kind of code that directly manipulates the filesystem in bmcweb breaks the OpenBMC architecture in kind of unfortunate ways.  Per the other handlers, the business logic for this should be going into its own daemon and schema, which IBM can maintain, and bmcweb can just call the dbus interface to like we would anything else, which would remove me from most of the management console lock code reviews, and let ibm implement their business logic however they wanted \ud83d\ude0a\n\nCan we discuss timeframes on when/how that changeover can happen?

I really do think you guys would move faster with your own application.

I kind of assumed this management console stuff was dead, given that I haven't seen many updates to it.\n\nIs there a path where we can do incremental progress, so you can get your patches merged, and we can make progress toward a better end solution, where IBM can maintain their application and interfaces the same as we would any other application.

Probably we could not recreate the original issue and this change really was not the 'fix'? But i don't see any harm in calling these file APIs explicitly.\n\nIt's extra code, and if our RAII model (suggested by cpp core guidelines) is broken in the std library, then this is important.\n\n> I can move these back to the old code if you strongly feel that there could be issues if i call the close() explicitly. \n\nI don't feel strongly either way, I'd like to understand why an explicit close() changes the code paths at all.  RAII should be covering us here, and the std library documentation backs that up, so we need to at least understand it.\n\n> \n> > I kind of assumed this management console stuff was dead, given that I haven't seen many updates to it\n> \n> These APIs are used by IBM systems, and we had not pushed any code upstream recently due to other priority work-items.\n> \n> > we can make progress toward a better end solution\n> \n> The use-cases in this file does not have any dbus interactions.\n\nMy point is that it should be calling dbus.  This code is doing blocking filesystem calls to a filesystem that could lock up (ie, not read only tmpfs that common_errors.md documents as ok and basically never blocks).  If the RW filesystem has any issues, bmcweb will effectively brick, which is a stability issue.\n\n> They are contained within the bmcweb only.
