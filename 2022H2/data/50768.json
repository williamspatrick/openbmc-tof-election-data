Entities in many cases are a COLLECTION of i2c devices, so this information needs to drop down to the next level, and get attached to each individual sensor.  Most of the dbus-sensors instances already have this information (bus + address), so it should be pretty trivial to just make dbus-sensors include this information by default, with no configuration needed at all.\n\nWith that said, I'm still not sure WHY it's needed after reading this message, so lets regroup and figure that out.\n\nDecorator.IPMI might have the same issue, although to a lesser extent?"
