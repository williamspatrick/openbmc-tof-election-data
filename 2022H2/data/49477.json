Entity-manager is for common code.\n\n> through this reactor deamon will read and parse the ncsi command and get the output as 8-bit or 16-bit.\n\nAH, now I understand.  Let me make sure I have it right.\n\n1. BMC reads the NCSI ID of the NIC\n2. The NCSI id will determine if the NIC has a 16 bit or 8 bit eeprom\n\n\nThat makes more sense.  In that case, your flow would be:\n\n1. Update NCSId to expose an appropriate dbus API for determining the \"model\" or \"ID\" of the card.  You might need to invent a new interface here.\n2. Write an EM config file that uses that dbus API for its probe statement.\n3. In the EM config file, add a \"Size\" flag under the Type: \"EEPROM\" field.\n4. Update FruDevice to check EM configs, and lookup the size field appropriately if it's defined in an EM config.\n\n\nThe advantage of the above design is that there's no new platform-specific code, and it's reusing most of the infrastructure that exists already.\n\n> Then it will update the 8-bit or 16 bit device byte type in Dbus interfaces of FRU device and read from it.\n> \n> Question:Is it fine to have the deamon(detector EEPROM) in entity-manager?\n\nIn the above what I've written, there are no new daemons here.\n\nNCSID exists (although would need to be promoted out of the meta-google repo if more people are going to use it)\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-google/recipes-google/ncsi/ncsid_git.bb\n\nThat would be the thing that exposes the NCSI device model number."

From there entity-manager can generally configure the size of the eeprom, which doesn't need to be platform specific.\n\n> This EEPROM byte detection is platform specific.\n\nIMO, based on what you've written, I don't think it is.
