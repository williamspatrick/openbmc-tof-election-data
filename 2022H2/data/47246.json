I don't have the time to piece apart this patchset to figure out what's \"new\" and what's just being moved.  Please separate your code \"moves\" into a separate patchset from your additional features.\n\nAs discussed Earlier, I split the Ipmb based Fru feature patch into two patches(1. Moving common code to FruUtils.cpp and 2.Ipmb related changes). This is first patch. I am just moving the common functions getFRUInfo, updateFRUProperty, addFruObjectToDbus from FruDevice.cpp to FruUtils.cpp. While moving functions, I had to move some variables to globals/.hpp files to make it common for other files. Created FruDeviceMain.cpp file to organize all the codes and make it easy for other Fru's implementation. \n\nOther than this, just fixed Magic number and hardcoded strings in FruDevice.cpp(we can skip these minor fixes now or move these minor fixes into separate minor patch)\n\nAdded new header files (FruDevice.cpp) and added functions declarations. Added functions declarations in FruUtils.cpp. Because of these changes, Stats shows the difference in number of lines.\n\nStill, not submitted the patch no : 2( Ipmb related changes ). Once this patch get merged, I will submit this patch."

Modify the addFruObjectToDbus method on line 641 to accept addFruObjectToDbus by a non-const reference.\n\n\nThis removes the need for the global entirely.
