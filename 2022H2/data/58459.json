Both are just suggestions/things to think about vs. a bug.\n\nComment #1: You could use sdbusplus::bus::match::rules::interfacesAdded() and sdbusplus::bus::match::rules::argNpath() here instead of hardcoding the match properties.  Not a big deal, but might buy you a little abstraction in case the D-Bus match property names ever changed.\n\nComment #2: argNpath has kind of unexpected (to me) behavior.  From https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html\n\n\"... there is also a match when either the string given in the match rule or the appropriate message argument ends with '/' and is a prefix of the other. An example argument path match is arg0path='/aa/bb/'. This would match messages with first arguments of '/', '/aa/', '/aa/bb/', '/aa/bb/cc/' and '/aa/bb/cc'.\"\n\nThat might be what you want, but I find it a little strange.  e.g. your rule would match if arg 0 is '/'."
