In this role, you're not a maintainer for google, you're a maintainer for all of openbmc, so you need to consider more hardware than just Googles.\n\n> That's how I tested all the commits I did in the project and some commits that I reviewed. You reviewed most of the patches and should have seen I said tested on hardware in the commit message.\n\nYep, and basically all of those I tested on real upstream hardware to verify that it worked, because I'm the maintainer and that's part of the responsibility.  If you're becoming a maintainer with this commit, that responsibility will transition in part to you for the things you maintain.\n\n> \n> I don't have a public hardware. I believe most of Google contributors don't have a public hardware.\n> \n> What I was saying is that, for the parts that I maintained, testing on Google hardware is sufficient. Is that fair?\n\nConsidering that google has patches against many subsystems, no, generally testing only on downstream systems isn't sufficient to verify that they meet the published dbus interfaces.  Many times we have patches that are only tested on downstream clients, and cause bugs in upstream because of it;  It's a maintainers job to use judgement on how much to accept."
