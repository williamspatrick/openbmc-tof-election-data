However, the race at boot against slow-to-register hardware is one scenario in which retrying would be more desirable. Since race conditions shouldn't happen in well-designed systems, I am leaning more towards permanent failure, just to make it really obvious when there's a race condition so that people can notice and fix it.\n\nThis is more of a design decision, though.
