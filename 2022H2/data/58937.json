At best, forwarding it as-is is incorrect, because it can't be resolved post-aggregation.  That's why I'm suggesting removing it.  There's no \"good\" way to make it correct, and I'd rather it just not be there than be wrong.\n\n>  That seems like opening a big can of worms.\n> \n> In this specific case it looks like the values would look like \"/redfish/v1/$metadata#ComputerSystem.ComputerSystem\".

With that said, maybe aggregating it would give the right behavior?
