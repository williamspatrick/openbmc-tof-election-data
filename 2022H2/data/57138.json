To avoid confusing, I referred them explicitly as FB-OpenBMC and LF-OpenBMC accordingly in all of my comments. \n\nMETA has a long term goal to make LF-OpenBMC another valid choice for BMC s/w when design META's OCP servers. So porting FB-OpenBMC's specific features (i.e. measured boot) to LF-OpenBMC is the step stone to achieve this goal. \n\nAs the design is proposing a same feature that I want to port to LF-OpenBMC, I think it is a good idea to leverage the discussion of this design proposal to introduce FB-OpenBMC's measured boot to the community and collects comments regarding porting FB-OpenBMC measured boot to LF-OpenBMC.\n\nSo,I comments inline providing the design/implementation information of FB-OpenBMC measured boot for your reference only.\n\n\n \n\n\n"
