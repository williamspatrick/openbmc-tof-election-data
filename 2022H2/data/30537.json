For my situation, I think I may need to know if its OPAL or PHYP when the OsStatus  property changes to say the host is running.  It sounds then like I can just read this property, and not have to worry about it not being accurate (like from someone setting it to take affect on the next boot already)."

For the same reason you stated. Since this reflects a user setting, it is possible that a user change the setting at any point of time. The host firmware will come and read it only the next time.\n\nWhat you're looking for has to be a different object/property on D-Bus, and is not the purpose of this one."
