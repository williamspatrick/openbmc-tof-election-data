Because entity-manager monitor all of D-Bus interface and it is designed to only start the probing entity configuration when there are no new signal in 5 seconds. This leads the sensors are created late.\nThis is one of disadvantage of entity-manager and dbus-sensor model when compares with hwmon.\nMoreover, there are some sensors such as fans are used by thermal controls. At the boot up of BMC the thermal control services will start early to cool down the system. The delay in creating the fan sensors will need the unexpected action of thermal control services.\nThis patch set will limit the D-Bus signals are monitor by entity-manager to prevent the flood so the sensor configurations can be probed early. In that way, D-Bus sensors can create the sensors early."

From the probe D-Bus interface we can find the D-Bus services which create that D-Bus interface. Then we can use those service as sender filter for added/removed_interface signal. But there is one issue that matching signal is created when we start entity-manager, but at that time the source service of the D-Bus interface of the Probe configuration is not available. So we can't find the service name.\nUsing the service name configuration still is required."
