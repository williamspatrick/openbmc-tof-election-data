We could put in a separate fork or on the mailing list...but the first does not get much visibility to the community, and the second rarely happens for whatever reason (a certain portion of our community still isn't real comfortable with the mailing list).\n\nI think a lot of these OEM functions have potential to be something that could move into OpenBMC proper, it's usually a time and resource debate. And why put the effort in if there isn't someone else interested in the function...yet.\n\nI think high-level, yes anyone from any company could put designs in a oem sub-directory. The more designs the better in my opinion :) \n\nBut, I don't have any strong feelings here. We could definitely keep these in a fork of the repo. TOF question? Mailing list poll maybe?"

But specifically, you want to see them _here_ - in this repository, and not elsewhere.\n\nWhat I am looking to understand is how these designs impact developers.  Lets say I want to make an architectural change for one reason or another, and the way ecmd is integrated into OpenBMC would be impacted by my change.  Is there an expectation that as I do my work, I consider how ecmd is integrated and fix the documentation?  Or is that up to the owners of the OEM folder, in this case IBM?\n\nI hope the problem with the former is obvious - this doesn't scale and will cause the project to stagnate.  If it is the latter, I'm fairly sure that information will become stale and misleading in short order, which really hurts project newcomers.  I'm not calling out IBM specifically - I'm thinking about the general case, myself included, if we open the floodgates to anyone and everyone.\n\nWhatever the answer is, I think we should spell that out in a README in the OEM folder.\n\n> TOF question?\n\nProbably.\n\n> Or why does this need separate maintainership?\n\nThe answer to this really depends on the answer to my question above - what is the expectation on developers when these documents are impacted by the work they do.\n\n> I worry if OpenBMC says company-specific documents shouldn't go in the docs/ repo, there will be common requirements that don't get pushed upstream. :/\n\nIf you assume that people will not use the mailing list to talk about the work they are doing, then yes I understand this concern."

I don't have the bandwidth to review every design document in this space.  The majority of these designs are not applicable to anyone except this one weird IBM design, so I can't even see most maintainers wanting to devote resources to reviewing these designs.  On top of that we haven't even begun to have a discussion of what the code impacts of this are and if we even want to maintain the aspects of this design in the rest of the code-base.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/openbmc/6497C254-2BB5-4545-B251-A87AE6A5B503@gmail.com/\n\nPersonally, if IBM wants to use this subfolder as a collaboration point among themselves, I have no issue with it.  That's why I suggested this commit be made.\n\nIt should be very clear that any design \"accepted\" here does not mean there is community consensus on them.  I'm expecting the IBM team to distill out the pieces that are going to impact the rest of the code-base and populate them as a non-OEM design."
