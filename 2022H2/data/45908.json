If the config files say \"Use cracklib\" it will try to use cracklib, and return errors if it doesn't exist.  What you describe would likely be a security vulnerability, as it would silently skip required modules."

Bitbake recipe PACKAGECONFIG remains a mystery to me, so I am not commenting on the best way to accomplish your goal.\n4. It seems like if you can guarantee that pam_chauthtok() can never be called, then you wouldn't need any Linux-PAM modules dedicated to password changing, such as pam_pwhistory and pam_ipmisave, and you can avoid building them too.\n5. I don't see any corresponding changes to /etc/pam.d/common-password in this commit.  To be safe, you should configure /etc/pam.d/common-password to simply invoke pam_deny.so."

If you notice we are currently pinning PAM to an older version than what the recipe upstream is (we've been avoiding updating this recipe when doing subtree updates).  I think cracklib is one of the libraries removed upstream and PAM recommends something else to replace it, but nobody has done all the necessary work between phosphor-user-manager and these recipes to remove it.  In that case, it would be replaced with the \"new library\" recommended upstream that provides similar functionality.\n\nYou may want to keep that in mind and keep track of our PAM recipe to know when this functionality is replaced (and thus all these overrides would similarly need updating).\n\nAdding in Richard, Joseph, and Ratan."
