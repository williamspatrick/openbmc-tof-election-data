The namespace event logs created in the para are `/xyz/openbmc_project/logging/gpu0/entry/1` which would at location `/var/lib/phosphor-logging/errors/gpu0`. \n\nCode wise, we are essentially creating new D-Bus paths (e.g. `/xyz/openbmc_project/logging/gpu0/entry/1`) per namespace, a new internal manager instance per namespace will take care of creating the log on the persistent file system and create a corresponding D-Bus object. \n\nDoes this help answer the question?"
