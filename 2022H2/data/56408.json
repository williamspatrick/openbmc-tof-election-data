It is used to differentiate the various sensors from a single device.\n\nFor example, the D-Bus sensor names from the phosphor-regulators app for voltage regulator 'vdd1' are:\n* vdd1_iout\n* vdd1_iout_peak\n* vdd1_iout_valley\n* vdd1_pout\n* vdd1_temperature\n* vdd1_temperature_peak\n* vdd1_vout\n* vdd1_vout_peak\n* vdd1_vout_valley\n\nI see similar D-Bus sensor names from other sensor-providing apps, such as:\n* ps0_temp0\n* Ambient_2_Temp\n\nSensor names had to be unique in the Redfish Sensors output and in the GUI.  There can also be several sensors that fall into the same D-Bus sensor category, such as 3 regulator sensors dealing with voltage.\n\nWith this change, the type will be in the Redfish sensor name/URI twice:\n* current_vdd1_iout\n* temperature_vdd1_temperature\n* voltage_vdd1_vout\n* temperature_Ambient_2_Temp\n\nThis seems like confusing change for end users."

ObjectManager is a requirement in the sensor schema, it is not in the inventory schemas (well, until recently).\n2. This patchset does use the same code for all the parsing routines.  There is almost no duplication in the construction of the json object for sensor versus not.  The only primary additive difference is the code to actually do the GetAll call.\n3. This common code is used to construct 3 different schemas (Sensors, Power, Thermal), so in comparison to inventory, which has lots of code with very little reuse between daemons, as well as many more redfish routes to service in the long run (maybe 12 different inventory schemas?), duplication in sensor code doesn't lead to a large difference in binary size."

In the ideal case, some of this file needs broken out into \"sensor utils\" outside the lib folder so that it's more clear which parts are common between handlers, and which parts are independent.\n\n@krzysztof is there a good set of tests for Telemetry, or some use cases you can recommend?  I'm not very familiar with the TelemetryService stuff, but Gunnar is totally right, I need to do some testing there (and it's quite possible this patch breaks telemetry service).\n\nI will take a look at this async and try to tease out what changes if any need made there."
