StaticNtpServers moves to an interface that is global across the BMC\n2. NTPServers property on EthernetInterfaces moves to read-only\n3.

We already have to work around the issue in odd ways, and now the code is going to get more complex, but sure, if we have use cases where per-nic NTP servers is required, I guess that makes sense.\n\nI would've assumed that if you had per-NIC ntp servers, the gateway routing and subnet routing would be used to determine which nic to communicate with each NTP server on, but I guess systemd thinks that's too complex.\n\n> \n> On the point (2) - already we had made this change and that got reverted.
