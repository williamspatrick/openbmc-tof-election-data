As an alternate, can create new interfaces for each of the object identified from the inventory. Then user can sets the new \"biosUpdate\" property to \"true\" for devices that needs firmware update.

I don't see any reason to restrict the multi-item update process to \"firmware\" either by calling it \"fw update\".\n\n2. What we're really doing here is extending Activation so that the Activation is applied across a set of Inventory items.  I would suggest instead we create an interface maybe called ActivationItems (Elements?) which has a property : Items type=array<object_path> and maybe a method : AddItem(object_path).  The object_paths will reference the Inventory item to be updated.  When the activation is done the the update code will apply to all the applicable Inventory objects in the Items array.  We may need a signal for failed updates, especially in the case where the update image does not apply to the item.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to see Activation refactored in a way where it can support a direct relationship between the SoftwareVersion and the Inventory item(s) to be updated.  I think there are some cases where you'll want to do an update to all the devices and some cases where you'll want to do the update one at a time but still without deleting the update at the end.  In my mind, the default behavior of the system should be to *not* delete an update for which there still exists an Inventory item that the update *could* apply to, unless the user explicitly Delete's the update."

I don't really know how this solves the issue of tracking the completion of systemd services that we have started in the updater process.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\n- If there is a service kicking off a custom tool for applying an update, don't you want that service to exit once the update is done?  So it will never have Progress.Status = Completed or Aborted because it will simply exit.\n\n- If the service doesn't exit, how do we garbage collect them?\n\n- How do you ensure that two updates are not applied to the same device in close proximity (ie, while one is updating the other one is started)?\n\n- What do we do if the update fails in the middle?  Are any errors reported back to the ItemUpdater?  Or is it expected to monitor for the systemd status on the service it kicked off?"

This progress of Completion is calculated based on the total\nand completed image size. This Value is updated in the service\n\"xyz.openbmc_project.oem_firmware_update\" with new property.\nItemUpdater can read this progress of completion from this Dbus-interface.\n\nSo, custom tool keep on updating the progress in the dbus properties in \"xyz.openbmc_project.oem_firmware_update\" service. For example : It will update as completion status with 25% or 50% or 100%. \n\n2. Custom flash tool can be updated with setting timeout option for every\nchunk of data sent via Ipmb command. If update is not happening till that\ntimeout period then we set the status as Aborted.\n\nIf the service is not exist for some timeout, it might go to abort status.\nif status is aborted, dbus-proeprties can be updated with Abort status.\nItemupdater can remove the images if status is aborted.\n  \n3. The Inprogress status can avoid the two image updates on same device.\nItemUpdater can activate the images only if that is not in the Inprogress state. \nSo, we can ensure that two updates are not applied on the same device.\n\n\n4. If any errors or update fails in the middle, that status can be updated in the\ndbus-properties and based on this ItemUpdater can get the error status from\ndbus-properties."

For Firmware updates in general, activation means the firmware is being moved from a staged to a running state.  Staging the firmware is normally the first step (e.g. copying it down to the device).  Activation is typically a second state which can occur either at the same time as staging or done at a later time.  Activation implies changing the device from running the current firmware image to the newly staged image.  \n\nCan you clarify here and in this section in general whether Activation implies staging or if there is a separate state that needs to be accounted for here."
