Should we instead spread out the owners files to the various sub directories of the meta layers that you include in the subtree?\n\nMy thinking for this isn't so much out of lack of trust for you, but the idea that others might want to own updating a subtree that you don't care about.  As a strawman example: at some point, I might want to add meta-clang, so we can build code against clang and gcc.  Assuming you didn't care about it, or want to manage that subtree, I could add myself as an owner, and be responsible for keeping that tree up to date."
