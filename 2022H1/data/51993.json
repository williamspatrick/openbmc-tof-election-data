    "commitMessage": "Generate Redfish enums from schemas\n\nOpenBMC tends to have a significant problem in doing the appropriate\nlookups from the schema files, and many bugs have been injected by users\npicking a bad enum, or mistyping the casing of an enum value.\n\nAt the same time, nlohmann::json has recently added first class support\nfor enums, https://json.nlohmann.me/features/enum_conversion/\n\nThis commit is looking for input on how to proceed, and whether this is\nworthwhile.  It is WIP at best.\n\nThis commit attempts to build a redfish include file with all the\navailable Redfish enums in an easy to use enum class.  This makes it\nvery clear which enums are supported by the schemas we produce, and adds\nvery little to no extra boilerplate on the human-written code we\nproduced previously.\n\nNote, in the generated enum class, because of our use of the clang-tidy\ncheck for macros, the enum classes all need to be marked NOLINT.  This\nseems like a reasonable compromise, and in this case, given that\nnlohmann doesn't support a non-macro version of this, it seems\nreasonable to do.\n\nOne question that arises is what this does to the binary size....  Under\nthe current compiler optimizations, and with the current best practices,\nit leads to an overall increase in binary size of ~1200 bytes for the\nenum machinery, then approximately 200 bytes for every call site we\nswitch over.  We should decide if this nominal increase is reasonable.\n\nTested: WIP\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: I7c7ee4db0823f7c57ecaa59620b280b53a46e2c1\n",

It is also nice that the strings can be associated to their respective XML, which can't be done with raw strings.\nI was originally wary of the monolithic include file. Trying to find the correct item in a large blob of text may be daunting. In this case the XML file name helps zero in on the enum values. It also avoids the need to include svc-enums1.hpp, svc-enums-2.hpp, ... svc-enums-x.hpp. IMO that makes the large include file acceptable.\n\nI can't find an argument to make against implementing this concept."

For example, \n\nLDAPService\n\nshould arguably be\n\nldapService\n\nin our naming convention, but there's no way to automatically determined that LDAP is an acronym in code, so we'd have to special case all the cases, which I don't think is worth the complexity."

This was all evaluated by someone previously on your team (Pawel), and the conclusion at the time what that essentially anything else we tried resulted in slower builds, larger binaries, and longer runtimes.  That was done several years ago, so we could certainly reassess with current technology and our now better understanding of what dbus->redfish conversions need done.\n\nThe biggest problem becomes that most dbus->redfish conversions are not as clean as this one.  There are cases where:\n- New enums are added without bmcweb being made aware.\n- two dbus enum values might map to one redfish value.\n- one dbus property might map to multiple redfish values in odd ways (Status is a good example of this).\n\nAll of those cases need to be able to be handled.\n\n> It would be possible to take conversion map and string value as parameter. Perform find, return value if success or empty optional/invalid on failure.\n\nWhen we tried this, we either needed to declare a runtime std::map which we could either construct on global init, or construct on each use.  In the former it slowed the boot time, and used runtime memory (against some of the core bmcweb principles).  In the latter case, it was significantly slower to construct the map, do the lookup on the map, then destroy the map each time it was used.\n\nSince we did that testing, boost::describe was added into boost, which might solve some of these issues in a cleaner way, but that would need to be evaluated.  What nlohmann implements is essentially similar to what boost describe does, but specializes it for json values.\n\n> \n> That could remove some code, but I don't know if this going to decrease or increase binary size.\n\nHappy to see test results if you're interested in pursuing this."
