    "commitMessage": "Make clang-tidy propose diffs\n\nclang-tidy supports a -fix option, which will directly apply the diffs\nthat it's able to do automatically to the tree.  This is advantageous\nfor developers, because it gives them a quick way to \"do as the robot\ncommands\" when run locally, and makes it more obvious in the output\nexactly what's being asked for in a changeset.\n\nUnfortunately, to use this feature, the run-clang-tidy script needs to\nbe run from the build folder directly, which involves a cd into the\ndirectory.  We actually already had to do this for cmake elsewhere in\nthis file, but it didn't get propagated to meson builds.\n\nAt the same time, when run-clang-tidy fails to run, catch the error and\nrun the same \"git diff\" procedure that we run elsewhere such that the\ndiff is printed to the console.\n\nTested:\nUpdated clang-tidy to include a new check for\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/50660\n\nand ran run-unit-test-docker.sh, and observed that both the bmcweb tree\nhad been updated locally, and the diff was printed to the console\noutput.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: I04ef8c136c8e72e7787cebe018cfe2289d7f2c59\n",
