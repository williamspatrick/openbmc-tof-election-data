    "commitMessage": "Start to document maintainer responsibilities\n\nIn the past, a number of contributors have inquired about what bmcweb\nmaintainers do, and how they can become one.  As bmcweb grows in\npopularity and scope, it's important that we be able to spread out the\nload amongst more maintainers, and make sure that we're including\ncommunity members, while still keeping the core principles that made\nbmcweb attract so many users intact.\n\nTo that end, I've attempted to document, in the OWNERS file, the basic\nresponsibilities that are required to be a maintainer within bmcweb.  I\nvery much expect that this list evolves over time, but this is expected\nto be a starting point, and a place to point people that are interested\nin becoming a maintainer of bmcweb.\n\nAs a pattern, I would like to see this kind of \"how to be a maintainer\nof this component\" called out in more repositories, as I believe it\nopens up the community to more people, common solutions, and better\nresults.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: Id156edd7e340df9432bf5a8a73e8a117b5d4099a\n",
