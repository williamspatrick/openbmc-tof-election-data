    "commitMessage": "entity-manager: Allow exposing Inventory.Item\n\nCurrently, the Exposes section only produces\nxyz.openbmc_project.Configuration interfaces. This change allows\nxyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item interfaces to be populated by the\nExposes directive. Only root-level JSONs can Expose items; Expose\ndirectives nested in other Exposes will be ignored.\n\nThis change does not replace the practice of splitting a large inventory\ninto multiple .json files, because a BMC cannot become a separate .json\nfile (explained below).\n\nThe only use case so far is to enable phosphor-health-monitor to report\nthe BMC's ManagerDiagnosticData through Redfish. The reasons are:\n\n1) bmcweb should make DBus calls to collect data needed for filling\n   in the ManagerDiagnosticData response, rather than fetching the\nreadings (such as CPU/memory/RWFS usage, boot time, process list) by\nitself. Data for ManagerDiagnosticData should be already made available\non DBus similarly to sensor readings by phospohr-health-monitor so that\nbmcweb does not need to perform too much processing. This is discussed\nin change 46081.\n\n2) bmcweb should have a way to differentiate the DBus objects used for\n   populating ManagerDiagnosticData against the sensor DBus objects.\nThis distinction cannot be made solely by the name of the DBus object,\nbut rather, they should be obtained through Association definitions,\nsimilarly to how sensors are found by their chassis objects.  This is\nalso discussed in change 46081.\n\n3) We need a DBus object for the DBus objects created by\n   phosphor-health-monitor to link to using the Association definitions.\nThis object should be able to represent the BMC itself. Some\npossibilities that have been considered are:\n   a) An xyz.openbmc_project.Software object\n      This object exists on most OpenBMC systems but a Software object\n      was considered not to be of the right type.\n   b) An xyz.openbmc_project.Configuration.Bmc object\n      Although this object can be created easily using the existing\n      Exposes clause in Entity Manager, it is again not considered an\n      ideal choice.\n   c) An xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Bmc object\n      Although whether or not a BMC is an Inventory remains to be\ndebated and the existence of the Inventory.Item.Bmc dbus interface\nitself appears to be a result of some historical tech debt, it appears\nto be the most sensical DBus interface to use for representing the BMC\nitself.\n\n4) There naturally comes the question of which daemon should be\n   responsible for creating the BMC object. Several possible ways of\ncreating and using choices b) and c) with their pros and cons listed:\n\n   1) phosphor-health-monitor creates an Item.Bmc object and the DBus\n      objects used to populate ManagerDiagnosticData are associated with\nthe object.\n      Pros: does not involve E-M, simple to implement.\n      Cons: we lose the opportunity to capture the relationship between\nthe BMC and the board it's physically located on, and are violating the\n\"inventory items should be hosted by E-M\" rule.\n\n   2) A Configuration.Bmc item is added by Exposing the BMC\n      configuration in its corresponding board .json E-M configuration.\nThen, upon seeing the Configurtion.Bmc object, phosphor-health-monitor\ncreates an Item.Bmc object for the ManagerDiagnosticData objects to be\nassociated with.\n      Pros: feasible with existing E-M functionalities.\n      Cons: this approach feels too redundant and still violates the\n\"inventory items should be hosted by E-M\" rule.\n\n   3) A Configuration.Bmc item is added similarly to 2), but the\n      ManagerDiagnosticData objects are associated directly to the\nConfiguration object.\n      Pros: feasible with existing E-M functionalities.\n      Cons: associating ManagerDiagnosticData DBus objects with a\nConfiguration.Bmc object is not a good approach from bmcweb's view.\n\n   4) The BMC is added as the property of its Board in the board\n      configuraion .json E-M config, and the ManagerDiagnosticData\nobjects are associated with the Board object.\n      Pros: same as 3) above\n      Cons: same as 3) above\n\n   5) Add a new .json object for the BMC itself to create an Item.Bmc\n      object. The ManagerDiagnosticData objects are associated to the\nItem.Bmc object.\n      Pros: looks reasonable\n      Cons: first, the BMC does not have an FRU that can be detected.\nThere is no suitable \"Probe:\" field to fill in for its .json\nconfiguration. Second and more importantly the BMC is not an Inventory,\ni.e. a physical object one can hold in hand. This means this approach is\nviolating the rationale of E-M.\n\n   6) Modify E-M so it can Expose an Inventory.Bmc item from within the\n      BMC's board's .json E-M config\n      Pros: fulfills the \"inventory must be hosted by E-M\" rule\n      Cons: need to modify E-M\n\nThe discussion for approaches 1~5, and a suggestion about modifying E-M\nto enable approach 6 was captured on the #inventory channel on Discord\non January 18, 2022.\n\nImplementation-wise, this change experiments with 3 methods for adding\nan Exposed item:\n1) Declare an exposed item with type (\"Exposes\": [...])\n   \"xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Bmc\", using either of the two\nfollowing formats:\n    a) { \"Type\": \"T\", \"Name\": \"X\", ... }\n    b) { \"T\": { \"Name\": \"X\", ... } }\n2) Declare a SubItem (\"SubItems\": [...]) with type \"BMC\", using either\n   of the two formats shown above.\n3) Add a \"HasThisBMC\" field in a board's .JSON file.\n\nTested: ASRock_E3C246D4I.json includes example changes demonstrating the\nmethods shown above. All 3 ways of adding a BMC item are included. With\nthose changes, the resultant DBus objects are:\n\nA resultant DBus object under SuperBoard is created as expected.\n\nroot@bmc:/tmp# busctl tree xyz.openbmc_project.EntityManager\n ...\n\u251c\u2500/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/ASRock_E3C246D4I\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/ASRock_E3C246D4I/Method_1_for_adding_a_BMC_Item_to_the_board_JSON\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/ASRock_E3C246D4I/Method_3_for_adding_a_BMC_Item_to_the_board_JSON\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/ASRock_E3C246D4I/BMC\n\nAll 3 objects can be found by the exposed Item.Bmc object via\nObjectMapper:\n\nroot@BMC:/tmp# busctl call xyz.openbmc_project.ObjectMapper \\\n/xyz/openbmc_project/object_mapper xyz.openbmc_project.ObjectMapper \\\nGetSubTree sias \"/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory\" 0 1\n\"xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Bmc\" a{sa{sas}} 3\n\"/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/ASRock_E3C246D4I/BMC\" 1\n\"xyz.openbmc_project.EntityManager\" 1\n\"xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Bmc\"\n\"/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/ASRock_E3C246D4I/Method_1_for_adding_a_BMC_Item_to_the_board_JSON\"\n1 \"xyz.openbmc_project.EntityManager\" 1\n\"xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Bmc\"\n\"/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/ASRock_E3C246D4I/Method_3_for_adding_a_BMC_Item_to_the_board_JSON\"\n1 \"xyz.openbmc_project.EntityManager\" 1\n\"xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Bmc\"\n\nSigned-off-by: Sui Chen <suichen@google.com>\nChange-Id: Ia2006df2d84fcd16301f5dce26d19976f32cff46\n",

A few ways that I know about:\n\nOne possibility is to examine the existing association graph. I took a look at some existing systems, this method doesn't guarantee a 100% precise result, since it appears association edges may be arbitrarily specified:\n\n* For some platform without a DC-SCM module that comes with multiple boards: the board that has the BMC also has a few BMC margin sensors associated with it, while the other boards do not.\n\n* For some platform with a DC-SCM module: A sensor appears to be including the DC-SCM module's name and \"bmc\" (the snapshot was obtained a while back, I'm not sure the meaning in the names ..)\n\nAnother possibility ... if the BMC can tell the interface used by the BMC<->host IPMI communication, it may be easier to guess which inventory the BMC is contained in. \"ipmipci\" probably indicates the BMC is on a DC-SCM module; \"ipmilpc\" probably indicates the BMC is on the motherboard. This, plus the association graph, may give some heuristics for the BMC to figure out its own location.\n\nSo the conclusion is I don't yet have a very good idea on how to enable the BMC to localize itself with what I currently know, but I can take a closer look at the \"association graphs\" or add a small program to test the \"heuristics\"."

Add a new flag \"SubItems\" to differentiate from the \"Exposes\" field (all objects in SubItems are prepended with \"xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.\" while all objects in Exposes are still prepended with \"xyz.openbmc_project.Configuration.\"\n\nIf this is a route you want to go down, lets talk through it, but it seems like a case where we would want multiple files (or maybe multiple definitions in one file) with associations between them to denote their connectedness, but, lets scope out what you're thinking and see if we can come to something similar."

Same as Exposes except that all items created will be Inventory.Item's rather than Configurations.\n\nI'm not sure which one is the best or if this change is to be considered together with other proposals such as 52487 (association interfaces for cables), and the discussion on Discord on April 15 (PhysicalLocation's).
