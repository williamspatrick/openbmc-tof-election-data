    "commitMessage": "only run power restore on AC losses\n\nAn internal defect was opened recently where it was noted that power\nrestore functionality should only be run in situations where the chassis\npower was on prior to the BMC being reset and off when the BMC comes\nback up.\n\nThis doesn't really align with the Redfish or PDI API we've defined\nthough. Why would there be an option to \"AlwaysOn\" if the expected\nbehavior was to not always execute the automatic power restore policy?\n\nPushing this up for discussion but I doubt it will be something we merge\nas-is.\n\nNote that the one-time aspect of the power restore policy is always\nlooked at. This is used for scenarios like inband code update where an\nautomatic power on is always needed after the BMC reboot.\n\nTested:\n- Verify no restore policy when not a power loss\n<6> One time not set, check user setting of power policy\n<6> Chassis power was not on prior to BMC reboot so do not run any power policy\n\n- Verify file is created on a blackout detection\nMar 14 20:27:46 p10bmc phosphor-chassis-state-manager[3450]: The system suffered a power blackout.\nroot@p10bmc:/lib/systemd/system# ls /run/openbmc/\nchassis@0-lost-power\n\n- Verify power restore is run when blackout occurs\n<6> One time not set, check user setting of power policy\n<6> Host power is off, processing power policy xyz.openbmc_project.Control.Power.RestorePolicy.Policy.AlwaysOff\n<6> power_policy=ALWAYS_POWER_OFF, set requested state to off\n\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Geissler <geissonator@yahoo.com>\nChange-Id: I882c056881bf6abde36bb11d3ae840c9b19d096a\n",
