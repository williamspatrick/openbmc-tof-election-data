    "commitMessage": "psu-ng: Missing power supply helper\n\nThe PowerSupply object will update a power supply to present when the\ndefault value of missing (present=false) changes to present\n(present=true). The PowerSupply objects do not know if a missing power\nsupply is required, so it does not mark power supplies as missing,\nunless the present property changes from true to false.\n\nAdd a function to the PSUManager for getting required power supplies\nthat are missing marked as missing in the inventory.\n\nWe need the entity-manager configuration information, to know how many\npower supplies are required.\n\nDo not skip over power supplies that have no input voltage.\n\nRead the D-Bus Present property to see if it was previously set. If no\nread failure is encountered attempting to read that D-Bus property, and\nthe value returned does not match the value returned by the PowerSupply\nobject, and the local configuration checking model variable indicates it\nis empty, then set the D-Bus Present property to false (missing). This\nshould fix Present true after it moved. Skip setting to false if\nproperty read failed (never set to true or false).\n\nCall updateMissingPSUs() in initialize() to handle when the process\nstarts up after entity-manager has already finished adding the\nconfiguration information to D-Bus. Call updateMissingPSUs() after\nentity-manager adds interface, possible configuration information.\n\nTested:\n  Rainier 1S4U (simulated):\n    Startup with bottom two power supplies present\n    Verify presence after BMC_READY\n      i2cdetect to scan bus, verify 0x6a and 0x6b.\n      D-Bus get-property Present for each supply.\n        powersupply0 - not set.\n        powersupply1 - not set.\n        powersupply2 - Present=true.\n        powersupply3 - Present=true.\n    Chassison\n    Verify no errors for missing power supplies.\n    Chassisoff\n    Verify no power supply errors....\n    Remove powersupply2.\n    Reboot BMC (substitute for AC reset)\n    Remove powersupply3 during reboot.\n    Install powersupply0.\n    Install powersupply1.\n    Verify at BMC_READY\n      No unexpected errors.\n      No dumps.\n      powersupply0 - Present=true, in bus scan.\n      powersupply1 - Present=true, in bus scan.\n      powersupply2 - Present=false, NOT in bus scan.\n      powersupply3 - Present=false, NOT in bus scan.\n    Chassison.\n    Verify no errors, same presence and scan results.\n    Chassisoff.\n    Swap power supplies back\n      Remove powersupply0\n      Reboot BMC...\n      Remove powersupply1\n      Install powersupply2\n      Install powersupply3\n    Verify at BMC_READY\n      No unexpected errors.\n      No dumps.\n      powersupply0 - Present=false, NOT in bus scan.\n      powersupply1 - Present=false, NOT in bus scan.\n      powersupply2 - Present=true, in bus scan.\n      powersupply3 - Present=true, in bus scan.\n    Chassison.\n    Verify no errors, same presence and scan results.\n    Remove powersupply2.\n    Install powersupply0.\n    Verify change.\n      110015F6 with powersupply2 callout\n      powersupply2 missing in scan and D-Bus property.\n      powersupply0 present in scan and B-Bus property.\n    Remove powersupply3.\n    Install powersupply1.\n    Verify change.\n      110015F6 with powersupply3 callout\n      powersupply3 missing in scan and D-Bus property.\n      powersupply1 present in scan and B-Bus property.\n    Remove powersupply0.\n    Install powersupply2.\n    Verify change.\n      110015F6 with powersupply0 callout\n      powersupply0 missing in scan and D-Bus property.\n      powersupply2 present in scan and B-Bus property.\n    Remove powersupply1.\n    Install powersupply3.\n    Verify change.\n      110015F6 with powersupply1 callout\n      powersupply1 missing in scan and D-Bus property.\n      powersupply3 present in scan and B-Bus property.\n\n  Rainier 2S4U (simulated):\n     1. Startup Rainier 2S4U with one power supply.\n     2. Verify 3 missing, 1 present, no errors at standby.\n     3. Add in 3 missing supplies, verify presence.\n     4. Reboot, verify presence, all four should be present.\n     5. Chassison.\n     6. Verify no errors.\n     7. Remove, verify, error, insert, for each supply.\n     8. Chassisoff.\n     9.

Verify psu0 missing, psu1 present, no errors at standby.\n     3. Add in missing psu0, verify presence.\n     4. Reboot, verify presence, both should be present (no extras)\n     5. Verify all good, then Chassison.\n     6. Verify no errors after chassison.\n     7. Remove, verify, error, insert, for each supply.\n     8. Chassisoff.\n     9. Verify no errors.\n    10. Verify both power supplies present.\n    11. Remove psu1.\n    12. Reboot, remove psu0, install psu1 (AC reset due to all remove,\n        and install psu1).\n    13. Check status...Verify psu0 missing, psu1 present.\n    14. Chassison, verify 110015F6...\n        # Hit other bug, powersupply2 and powersupply3 missing errors.\n    15.
