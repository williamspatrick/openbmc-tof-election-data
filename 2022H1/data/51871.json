    "commitMessage": "Let eslint use .gitignore file\n\nThere is a well documented issue when using eslint with a folder that\nalready has subprojects checked out.  A quick perusing of the eslint\ndocumentation shows that the eslintignore files happily accept a\n.gitignore file as its input.  Considering there might be repos that\nalready have put a .eslintignore file in place, rely on that if it\nexists, if it doesn't, fall back to .gitignore if it exists.\n\nWhile here, this exposed another issue that we were missing the\n--format=json command, and there were cases where eslint would make a\nmistake.\n\nTested:\nRan on bmcweb repo with subprojects checked out.  Observed build\nsucceeded.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: Iafab1d4d9e80a093a13b4c5a758a1f68bc37138c\n",
