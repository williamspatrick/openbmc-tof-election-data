    "commitMessage": "Created new script for validating Redfish Sensor Validation\n\nCreated new script for checking redfish threshold sensor validation.\nCreated new library file for getting values from dbus and sensor validation.\nSensors will be fetched dynamically from all chassis id present in \"/redfish/v1/Chassis\" uri.\n\nFollowing validations can be done by script against threshold based sensors from redfish sensor uri.\n\t- This script will check all threshold based sensor showing in redfish sensor uri has an reading value\n          and checks reading value length was within limit.\n\n\t- Threshold values from sensors from redfish sensor uri will be compared against threshold values got from dbus.\n\n\t- Based on sensor reading, sensor threshold value got from redfish sensor uri. It will checks sensor state was showing correctly\n          in redfish.\n\n\t- Script will validate whether all sensor thresholds were properly configured as per ipmi spec.\n\t\ti.e, If an sensor, has more than one threshold value. then those threshold value should not be same.\n\t\t\tThreshold values should be configured like below.\n\t\t\t\tLower threshold configuration - lnr < lcr < lnc\n\t\t\t\tUpper threshold configuration - unc > ucr > unr\n\n\t- Script will identify threshold based sensor, if it doesnt have even single threshold.\n\nMost of the keywords present in lib/sensor_info_record.robot from https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/openbmc-test-automation/+/54499\nwill be applicable for this script also. Hence, This MR file will have only dedicated keyword applicable for redfish sensor validation.\nCommon Keywords between ipmi and redfish sensor validation will be present in the above MR.\n\nSigned-off-by: ganesanb <ganesanb@ami.com>\nChange-Id: I28582311e617db49425fbb6aa9fa4afc86eaf72f\n",
