Given that there's only a 2 sentence commit message, it's hard to understand if the author has understood and mitigated these consequences, or has ignored them.\n\nThe patches are sent as POC changes and sorry I did not modify the title to indicate that.\n\nIt is breaking changes, and it's on purpose for below reasons:\n1. Before this change, with `-Dredfish-dbus-log=enabled` config option, the log entries's `Message` in `/redfish/v1/Systems/system/LogServices/EventLog/Entries` only show the exception name defined in phosphor-dbus-interfaces, e.g. \"xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InternalFailure\", and it does not provide any useful information.\n2. With `-Dredfish-dbus-log=enabled`, the event logs are expected to be the same as ipmi sel, because they consume the same /xyz/openbmc_project/logging/entry/xxx DBus objects.\n3. This change is the first step to change the behavior to make Redfish event logs to show the messages that are same as ipmi sel.\n4. If the community accepts this way, we could have follow up commits to parse the IPMI raw data and convert them into more meaningful message as what ipmitool does to parse the sel logs.\n\n> \n> On a design note, if this kind of data is needed in Redfish, we should be pulling from structured APIs, not parsing key=value type strings, as it pushes complexity into the redfish stack.\n\nFor now the additional data on DBus is `key=value`, so the code is written this way.\nIn future we could:\n1. Improve either the additional data to a more structured way, or make structured APIs in bmcweb to hide the details of parsing the additional data.\n2. move the function into a configure option so it could be disabled by default and enabled as needed."
