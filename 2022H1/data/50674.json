This should be the same logic, we cannot guarantee that the content of the file is 100% correct when deserializing.\n\n> \n> I wonder though if you hit this on file that was around that had no timestamps in it, and some point  along the way it got corrupted.\n\nI don't know when this file will be corrupted, because IBM had this problem when testing serviceCfgManager(https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/service-config-manager/+/50132), causing the process to keep core dumping\n\n> \n> Maybe in save() you could remove the file if there aren't any timestamps?\n\nNo, I think delete the file when the deserialization fails."
