Agreed on this possibly spawning hundreds / thousands of D-Bus interfaces which may not be desirable (I'm pushing back on the requirement for this as we speak)."

If we pick something like array[string] or map[size, string] the dbus property itself is going to become so large that I think it'll be fairly slow on its own, especially for applications which use the XML interfaces for introspection."

The reason why Microcode information at thread level is important is because there may be some errors with a core / thread where some threads are at a different Microcode version than all others.\n\nWith `map[string , set[size]]`, I guess we would \"expect\" the map should have 1 entry for 1 microcode -> threads (which bmcweb then would be in charge of creating the thread object), but if there's a problematic case, we would have 2 (or more) key-value pairs in the map that maps the different microcode that some other threads may have.\n\nLet me know if my understanding is correct.

What is a problem is if an implementation has an internal bug like [ \"version A\" -> [ 1 ], \"version B\" -> [ 1 ] ].  Doing a map[size_t, string] prevents this kind of bug, but it's just a bug and should be fixed if it is discovered.\n\n> Noting, we have the same thing at the core level currently (cores report microcode). Do you propose we change the core dbus as well?\n\nConsidering this is currently the only information in CpuCore, I'd tend to say we should remove that interface and do per-socket microcode information:\n\n    /.../socket_0/microcode/cores\n    /.../socket_0/microcode/threads\n\n(or microcode_cores could be workable)\n\nWe don't have as much scaling issues on cores, but we might as well make the interrogation consistent.\n\n> Otherwise, could it make sense to have this dbus interface as an optional one that people could use if their core / thread count isn't very large \n\nI don't think we want two ways to present the same information.  That just makes it more expensive to consume in applications like bmcweb because they have to implement both and we're going to end up with 2 different companies that prefer one over the other and one of the implementations will be broken half the time."
