While\nthis is non-ideal for reading comprehension, it's the rule we have at\nthe moment, so we should be consistent.\n\n12778e61c281b8f8c0f976dec225fb0c30edcb47 appears to have incorrectly\nchecked in a bad version of the privilege registry, which this commit\ndiffs out again.  I have inspected\nhttps://redfish.dmtf.org/registries/Redfish_1.2.0_PrivilegeRegistry.json\nby hand, and verified that those overrides are not present.\n\nTested: Whitespace changes only\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: I517a7cf13eba2dfd3211491c08ecce69ee68257f\n",
