Its i2c interface provides a standard\nIPMI FRU EEPROM and a PMBus device that reports typical power supply\nsensor readings.\n\nTested: on a Delta AHE-50DC, PSUs are recognzed and their sensors are\nreadable via the psusensor daemon.\n\nSigned-off-by: Zev Weiss <zev@bewilderbeest.net>\nChange-Id: I30f5fd684bfaf327290aad430facbade78c8d8c9\n",

I still think there's some kind of \"auto\" mode that we could come up with that would be the default, and would remove the need for explicitly putting this here.\n\n\nWith that said, you're right, this isn't a property of the PSU, but it's what we have today.\n\nThe chassis or the baseboard in specific instances can use DisableNode to provide a different set of parameters here."
