    "commitMessage": "Section out the maintainership of bmcweb\n\nAs bmcweb grows, it's important that we distribute the load amongst the\navailable community.  This commit pivots slightly from our usual process\nof giving full repo maintainership to a small list of one or two people,\nand instead proposes passing out smaller pieces of maintainership.  The\nhope is that over time, these maintainers can grow into owning larger\nportions of the stack.\n\nIn this way, we can increase our breadth of available maintainers for\nthe things that are straightforward, like adding new redfish schemas or\ndoing migrations, while still keeping a few core maintainers responsible\nfor the core.\n\nI've reached out to both Krzysztof and Nan, and asked them which pieces\nthey feel that they're comfortable maintaining, and I've added all\ncomponents they listed to the OWNERS files.  Each has a track record of\ndoing reviews in upstream, and given that Gunnar and myself will still\nbe present and active, this seems like a good thing for the project\noverall.\n\nThe specific sections of maintainership for each person is laid out in\nthe OWNERS file, and we can modify over time as each person gets more\nexperience in reviewing and testing.\n\nThe expectations are that for the files explicitly listed, these new\nmaintainers will be able to handle all reviews that touch those sections\nof functionality (including reviews not yet merged).  Please continue to\ncommunicate as you have previously.\n\nTo those being added, it is expected that if there are core issues\nbrought up in the modules that you maintain, you escalate them to the\nentire group of maintainers, and remain active on our communication\nchannels.  In the past, we've had significant issues where individual\nmodules tried to implement generalized solutions in a handler-specific\nway, and while most of that has been cleaned up, it caused significant\nthrash.  Lets try to avoid that going forward.\n\nI look forward to working with both of you more.\n\nChange-Id: I7750a12703af68fc82f84a0e22496dabca582208\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\n",
