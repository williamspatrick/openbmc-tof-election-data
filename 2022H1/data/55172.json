    "commitMessage": "monitor: Default tach sensors to true\n\nInstead of reading the functional status of the tach sensors out of the\ninventory on startup, just default them to true.  Any issues with the\nfans could then be rediscovered after the reboot.\n\nThis was the original behavior.  It was probably changed with the intent\nthat the shutdown timers could immediately start back up again after a\nreboot if things were nonfunctional before.\n\nIn practice, we've found that there can be a race between the shutdown\nactions turning off the system (due to nonfunctional sensors) and the\nsensor objects being marked functional again, even when the only reason\nthey were nonfunctional before the reboot was because the fan sensor\ndaemon was turned off before fan monitor on the way down.\n\nFor this to make a noticeable change, the shutdown actions/timers would\nhave to be in progress during the reboot anyway, which is pretty\nunlikely.\n\nWorst case, it would extend a shutdown by the time it takes an error to\nbe rediscovered, which is:\n\nIf the 'count' method is configured:\n    monitor_start_delay + (count_interval * threshold)\n\nIf the 'timebased' method is configured:\n    monitor_start_delay + nonfunc_rotor_error_delay\n\nThis has no affect on shutdowns caused by missing fans, as the code\nstill reads that out of the inventory on startup, plus it can be\ninstantaneously detected as opposed to being calculated over time.\n\nIn summary, extending the shutdown time in very uncommon cases seems\nbetter than mistakenly shutting off a running system, which can be a\nhuge deal depending on the user.\n\nSigned-off-by: Matt Spinler <spinler@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I2840c5f2e79bd734626b4144713e4428af28551a\n",
