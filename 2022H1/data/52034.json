    "commitMessage": "Implement ServiceEnabled property of SessionService\n\nPer Redfish spec, the ServiceEnabled property indicates whether the\nSessionService is enabled. When it is set to false, SessionService is\ndisabled, and new sessions cannot be created, old sessions cannot be\ndeleted, and established sessions can continue operating. This patch\nimplements this property by saving it in persistent data.\n\nNote that setting it to disabled will only affect session creation/\ndeletion from Redfish API. Sessions created by WebUI login and deleted\nby logout is not affected.\n\nTested:\n* After PATCH /SessionService with {\"ServiceEnabled\": false}, both POST\n  /SessionService/Sessions and DELETE /SessionService/Session/{ID} give\n  ServiceDisabled error message.\n* Log in from WebUI, a new session can be found under /SessionService/\n  Sessions, and that session is removed after logging out from WebUI.\n* Verified this property is persisted across BMC reboots, and saves to\n  bmcweb_persistent_data.json immediately on change.\n\nChange-Id: I117d94c04a52b5f8e135f3f90881ff42a0ee7b8f\nSigned-off-by: Jiaqing Zhao <jiaqing.zhao@intel.com>\n",

It seems quite easy to lock oneself out of the Redfish service this way if a user is able to disable their ability to log in, and considering that the only way to enable/disable this would be through an authenticated session, it seems like there would be no way to reenable it after disabling it.\n\nThe above commit message also doesn't explain WHY this is needed, so it's hard to hypothesize at possible solutions when it's not clear the problem you're attempting to solve.  Just because redfish has a property available to us, does not mean that a BMC needs to implement it.  Lets start by getting details on what you're hoping to do with this, and we can see if there's a solution for this, but as written, I don't think we can merge this feature given the potential for abuse."
