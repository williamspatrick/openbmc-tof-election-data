This\ncauses this service to fail and hold up the boot of the BMC by the 2\nminute timeout.\n\nOverride this service file to have IBM systems only wait for eth0 OR\neth1 to become active.\n\nHad hoped to just override the ExecStart command but as this is a\noneshot service, ExecStart commands in override files are just appended\nso overriding was not an option.\n\nTested:\n- Verified on system with only one network port configured that this now\n  quickly exits with success\n- Verified that a system with no configured port would still wait on\n  this service\n\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Geissler <geissonator@yahoo.com>\nChange-Id: I23c1a6f7417c4f29bf29ab13b6fe122bbd47085e\n",
