    "commitMessage": "Fix shadowed variable issues\n\nThis patchset is the conclusion of a multi-year effort to try to fix\nshadowed variable names.  Variables seem to be shadowed all over, and in\nmost places they exist, there's a \"code smell\" of things that aren't\ndoing what the author intended.\n\nThis commit attempts to clean up these in several ways by:\n1. Renaming variables where appropriate.\n2. Preferring to refer to member variables directly when operating\n   within a class\n3. Rearranging code so that pass through variables are handled in the\n   calling scope, rather than passing them through.\n\nThese patterns are applied throughout the codebase, to the point where\n-Wshadow can be enabled in meson.build.\n\nTested: Code compiles, unit tests pass.  Still need to run redfish\nservice validator.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: If703398c2282f9e096ca2694fd94515de36a098b\n",

It's obviously up to the maintainer here to decide if it should be enabled in order to reduce the trip-ups that are being encountered, but it isn't something we're necessarily enabling on the whole project.\n\n> This makes me question why OpenBMC C++ guide suggests using camelCase everywhere including class data members.\n\nMy personal preference is that we use lower_snake_case because that more closely aligns with the larger C++ library community, but a long time ago we decided on camelCase (with an escape hatch for lower_snake_case in some cases).  Anyhow, we opted for not having suffixes and/or different case between all the various types/scopes because it implies a lot more importance than it actually has, makes refactoring more invasive, and [probably] adds just as much mess and noise as this sample code in the overall scheme of things.\n\nA concrete example:\n    auto foo = bar();\n    \nIs bar a function or a class constructor?  Does it matter?  What if I initially make it a class but later on decide to make it a function that returns some private type (or vice-versa)?\n\nNormally there would be nothing wrong with continuing to use 'req' here except you've decided to enable -Wshadow, so now you're adding extra burden and noise on yourself."

                    "message": "> it isn't something we're necessarily enabling on the whole project.\n\nFWIW, I've been chasing this down in bmcweb for several years.  Almost every time I've turned on -Wshadow it has found real functional bugs where someone set a variable in a scope that then got destroyed, where they were intending to set the higher scoped one.  If it weren't such a pain to implement in existing code, I'd be an advocate for making it universal across the project, but alas, we do what we can do.\n\n>  including class data members.\n\nFWIW, Emily a while back changed the standard we use to allow using prefixes on variable data members, so in theory we could, but that's not the kind of change I want to effect at this point with people already having a ton of tree-wide breaking changes recently.  At some point, it would be interesting to look at what it does and how much we could automate it with clang-tidy.\n\n> My personal preference is that we use lower_snake_case\n\nFWIW, this is my preference as well, and bmcweb at one point _was_ written in lower_snake_case.  As part of becoming part of openbmc, it needed to follow the coding standard, so it was changed tree-wide, as it removed a class of argument against its inclusion in the openbmc tree at the time.\n\n>  Normally there would be nothing wrong with continuing to use 'req' here except you've decided to enable -Wshadow, so now you're adding extra burden and noise on yourself.\n\nFWIW, the usage here in a constructor has also caused bugs in the past in the form of:\n\nMyClass(std::string& string1):\n   classMember1(std::move(string1)), classMember2(string1)\n   \nif string1In is used instead, it's clear which variable you're referencing.  You can still write the code incorrectly, but it's more obvious that it's an issue."
