If\nan associated pgood fault also occurs, the power control/sequencer app\ncan make a determination of whether it is due to the power supply error.\n\nCall setPowerSupplyError method with null string during clearing of\nfaults.\n\nTested:\n    Simulated power supply faults followed by pgood fault.\n        Verified power supply fault used for source of pgood fault.\n    After PSU & pgood fault, poweron, try just pgood fault.\n        Verified pgood fault logged.\n    Real Rainier 2S2U normally fault free operation during poweron.\n    Real Rainier 2S2U VIN_UV fault works as expected.\n    Real Rainier 2S2U AC loss fault.\n    Real Rainier 2S2U injected pgood fault (no PSU error).\n\nChange-Id: Ia5c7c4fdcbd3b86c5184cb5bc6d93a9628747f18\nSigned-off-by: Brandon Wyman <bjwyman@gmail.com>\n",
