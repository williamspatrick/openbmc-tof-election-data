    "commitMessage": "host-reboot: enforce host boot count on host crash\n\nThe host reboot path can be triggered via paths outside of the normal\nRequestedHostTransition property set. For example, if the host crashes,\nit just triggers an automatic reboot using the systemd targets, which\nmeans the check to prevent continuous host reboots is not run.\n\nThis commit ensures we decrement the reboot counter when a host crash\noccurs, and it also ensures we check that count when deciding if a\nreboot should occur.\n\nWhile testing, it was found when we end in the host Quiesce state (after\nall reboot attempts have expired), the host stayed in Quiesce, even\nafter issuing a power off. The fix for that was to ensure the\nobmc-host-quiesce@.target conflicted with obmc-host-stop@.target to\nensure it would properly run on the power off request and update the\nhost state to Off.\n\nTested:\n- Verified that AttemptsLeft was properly decremented on host crashes\n- Verified that when AttempsLeft reached 0, the reboot was halted\n  and the host state was moved to Quiesced\n- Verified that once in Quiesced, system could be powered off, and a\n  boot worked fine (and AttempsLeft was back to 3)\n\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Geissler <geissonator@yahoo.com>\nChange-Id: I8d101b987517e160becc712ed70950f1d3204397\n",

The host shutdown target was not running since the host_crash target was hit first, and therefore was not not allowed to properly shutdown the host. You added a conflict with the host-stop target so that the crash target was not hit before the host-stop target. The script you added is then called during a phosphor-reboot service to apply the proper target to systemd."

This new bash script was added to ensure we don't reboot the host if it has used all of it's reboot attempts. So instead of blindly starting the target that boots the host, we check the reboot count now. If the host is out of reboots, we go to host-quiesce."
