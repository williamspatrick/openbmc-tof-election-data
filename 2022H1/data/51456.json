    "commitMessage": "Add review ratio to tof tool\n\nOpenBMC in general struggles to get enough code reviewers.  In an effort\nquantify this, add a new feature to the tof scoring tool to measure each\nindividuals \"review ratio\".\n\nReview ratio is defined as the number of reviews for which an individual\nwas given feedback, compared to the number of reviews in which the\nindividual gave feedback.  In a well organized system, a majority of\nindividuals would have ratios over 1.0, as that implies that for every\nchange that you pushed that required a review, you also reviewed someone\nelses.\n\nThis is an admittedly noisy measurement when done on a per review basis,\ngiven that a single review might have 40 patchsets that were reviewed\nbefore it was merged, but in terms of an abstraction, this is probably\ngood enough for the time being.  To reduce the noise, any reviews from\njenkins are also specifically removed from the counts, given that they\nweren't human effort to do the review/compile/static analysis.\n\nFunctionally, this changes the reviews.json structure from\nuser->list[reviews]\nto\nuser->from_others->list[reviews]\n    ->for_others->list[reviews]\n\nSadly, the report I ran for the last 6 months shows that 137 of the\n196 developers have a ratio of 0, which means that they ONLY push\npatches and don't review anything.  Measuring a problem is a good first\nstep to try to improve the situation.\n\nTested:\nRan the commands in the readme, and saw review_ratio show up.  Looked up\na few representative cases, and the results seemed sane.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: I99521361ff6d2e379b5d3ce15fb8380f21b6fb81\n",
