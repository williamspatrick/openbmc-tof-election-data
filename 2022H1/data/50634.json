    "commitMessage": "PEL: Wait a bit after host up before sending PELs\n\nWait a minute after the host state switches to running before sending\nany PELs to the host.  This applies both on a normal boot and also when\nthe BMC is rebooted when the host is already up.\n\nThis is being done for 2 reasons:\n1) Give some relief to the PLDM traffic and CPU load that occurs after a\n   BMC reboot when the host is already up, because the host will also be\n   exchanging PLDM PDRs with the BMC then and pretty much every\n   application is also starting up at the time as well.\n2) A lot of times on a normal boot the host notifier code ends up having\n   to do a few retries when it first starts sending the PELs because the\n   first few commands fail, possibly because the code on the receiving\n   end isn't quite ready yet.\n\nI arrived at that amount of time by deciding 30 seconds was reasonable,\nand then doubling it just to be sure.  During testing of the reboots the\nminute timeout gave plenty of time for the BMC to get back to BMC ready.\n\nSigned-off-by: Matt Spinler <spinler@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I0929a4acdda0a9fe8fbdcd624c5821a642ad83a6\n",
