    "commitMessage": "Update busInterfaceMap along with busMap\n\nFruDevice service exit, when trying to getFRUInfo on rescanOneBus.\nSometimes the mux device which is detected in the rootbus on\nrescanBusees is not detected while rescanOneBus.In this case\nthe device which is not detected is not updated in busInterfaceMap.\nAdded condition to check and erase the device from busInterfaceMap.\nAlso FRU device reduced after chassis power off/on. There is sdbus\nmatch for \"CurrentHostState\" and handler checks the HostState endswith\n\"Running\". \"CurrentHostState\" endswith \"Running\" on below two cases.\n-TransitionToRunning\n-Running\nSo the condition consider \"TransitionToRunning\" as \"Running\" and\nrescanBusses initiated before host start running. In this case\nFRU device not powered up and reading of device failed and bus\nadded into blacklist. So modified condition to check\n\"CurrentHostState\" as\n\"xyz.openbmc_project.State.Host.HostState.Running\"\n\nTested:\nSuccessfully build and FRUdevice service running without exit and\ncount was not reduced after power off/on.\n\nSigned-off-by: selvaganapathim <selvaganapathim@ami.com>\nChange-Id: Ife577a88b973d74f02f9372ab34046f9cf10927e\n",
