    "commitMessage": "Simplify InsertMedia action handler part 1\n\nThe main goal of this set of patches is to simplify BMCWEB_ROUTES\nhandlers (possibly get rid of lambdas in most places or simplify them).\nThis patch prepares the code base to be more reusable.\n\nFirst step is to minimalize InsertMedia post handler into single\nfunction executed from lambda.This function (findItemAndRunHandler)\ntakes name of node and function pointer to check whether node name is\nvalid. If so, handler is executed.\n\nSome things are temporary for sake of making this patch simpler.\n\n- Handler in this patch is a quite simple captureless lambda (will be\ntransformed to simple function)\n\n- findItemAndRunHandler function is rather large at this moment, but it\nwill be divided into smaller parts in future patcfhes\n\nTested:\nChecked for regressions. Mainly the following comands:\n- InsertMedia:\ncurl -X POST \"https://some_addr//redfish/v1/Managers/bmc/VirtualMedia/Slot0/Actions/VirtualMedia,InsertMedia\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"Image\":\"https://some_uri\", \"UserName\":\"some_username\", \"Password\":\"some_pass\" }'\n- EjectMedia:\ncurl -X POST \"https://some_addr//redfish/v1/Managers/bmc/VirtualMedia/Slot0/Actions/VirtualMedia,EjectMedia\"\n\nChange-Id: I29d5348341b189182b67da3438494338011703b1\nSigned-off-by: Przemyslaw Czarnowski <przemyslaw.hawrylewicz.czarnowski@intel.com>\n",

Can you please move the handling of this 404/403 condition to another patch, with an explanation of why its needed, and we can go from there?\n\n\"Method not allowed\" generally applies to a URI class handler, and if you're getting the wrong code, it generally means that the implementation wasn't specific enough when it registered handlers.\n\nAlso, FWIW, the specification is not very strict in this regard, given that actually seeing this behavior would require a user to ignore the redfish tree and write urls themselves, so as a general rule, I prefer to avoid complexity in that regard.  If we're going to go to those lengths to make sure method not allowed versus not found are correct, I'd like to at least understand the rules we're following, ideally with some changes to the error code section of the developing guide, and some examples of why the distinction in error codes is important to a user.\n\nLike I said, lets split out this portion of the change into another patch, and we can continue from there."
