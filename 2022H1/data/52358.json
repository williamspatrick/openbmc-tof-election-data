    "commitMessage": "Implement etag headers\n\nThis commit implements a limited support for the production of etags on\njson resources.  It is intended to cause two things:\n\n1. To get bmcweb to pass the PROTO_ETAG_ON_GET_ACCOUNT check, as well as\n   the redfish spec, which states: \"Implementations shall support the\n   return of ETag headers for GET requests of ManagerAccount resources.\"\n\n2. Begin discussions on what client-facing caching could look like in\n   the future, and to implement the fewest lines of code this author\n   could think of, with the hope of extending it later.\n\nAs written, it injects into the Response class a method that, for json\nresponses, uses std::hash<json> to generate an etag.  This was chosen\nunder the assumption that it caused the least binary impact, and is\nalready a function provided by nlohmann, so required minimal\nimplementation effort to get something that functioned to the standard:\nhttps://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/std_hash/#version-history\n\nI'm open to discussions if this should be improved in the future to\ninclude more entropy, or to be a \"weak\" etag, but I think starting\nwith std::hash is a good first step.\n\nThis patchset intentionally does notimplement handling of the\nIf-None-Match, or If-Match headers that a caching client would likely\nsend that implements this.  That is not explicitly required by the spec,\nrelatively complex, and probably has consequences that this author\ndoesn't want to write the test cases for (yet).  This lack of support\nmakes this patchset largely only \"useful\" in passing the tests, and\nimplementing the spec to the letter, it does not generalize a caching\nclient feature that improves performance.\n\nTested:\ncurl -vvvv --insecure --user root:0penBmc  https://192.168.7.2/redfish/v1\n\nContains in the response:\nETag: \"765E4548\"\n\nThe redfish protocol validator now passes the PROTO_ETAG_ON_GET_ACCOUNT\ntest, which increases our passing test count by 4 compared to previously.\n\nCurrent counts are 352 passing, 30 failing, 36 not tested.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: I3389b2ba98bf1276e1cb2d9c5954437b924f2d94\n",

In this case, the DateTime field is actually different.\n\n> If we would use the $select statement, does it still \"reduce unnecessary RESTful accesses\"? \n\nYes, I believe it does, because the payload for the select query wont have changed.\n\n> I just think it would be unfortunate if we don't use the benefit/purpose of ETags on such resources.\n\nAgreed, but I think select gets us both, so long as the client correctly forms their query."
