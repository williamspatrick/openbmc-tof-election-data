    "commitMessage": "Session cleaner is active until sessions close\n\nThe session cleaner needs to be active as long as there are active\nsessions. This is what culls stale sessions, whether fully set up or\nonly a partial set up. The timeout needed for the next cleanup depends\non how many active sessions there are, with a faster cleanup time when\nthe BMC is short on resources, hoping to close idle sessions sooner.\n\nPreviously there was a corner case that did not get caught, which is\nthat if there is only one session, the cleaner would fail to run unless\nanother session started. This is because the first session would call\ncleanup prior to fully activating the session, but then because it was\nnot activated, the cleanup code would not reschedule the cleaner.\n\nNow the new session calls cleanup and then also schedules a clean for\nlater. But with each new session doing that, code needed to be added so\nthat during times of stress, the new sessions did not increase the next\ncleaning timeout. So a new cleanup is only scheduled if one is not\nalready scheduled or if it is sooner than the currently scheduled\ntimeout.\n\nTested:\n    ran a single RMCPP connection and waited for an idle timeout\n    ran many concurrent RMCPP connections to see that the idle timeout\n        decreased as the number of sessions increased.\n\nChange-Id: I33347f62b8a14835e711bd0e7dbe6e50bb8bce64\nSigned-off-by: Vernon Mauery <vernon.mauery@linux.intel.com>\n",
