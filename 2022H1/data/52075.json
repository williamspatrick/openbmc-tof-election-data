    "commitMessage": "Add initial multi host system support for redfish\n\nOpenbmc's redfish core library currently primarily supports single\nhost bmcs.This change is added to adapt the redfish library for both\nsingle host and multihost bmc systems.\n\nThis change adds initial support to discover and populate multihost\nsystems as well as single host systems and support some system info\nqueries.The host systems discovery is based on number of host power\n state instances.(xyz.openbmc_project.State.Host).\n\nThe redfish url for single host system  is represented  by the name \"system\"\n\ni.e : /redfish/v1/Systems/system\n\nThe multi host system uses the same name with host number at the end.\n\n/redfish/v1/Systems/system1\n/redfish/v1/Systems/system2\n.\n.\n/redfish/v1/Systems/systemN\n\nThe change expects no impact on current single host implementation.\nIt only extends the support for multihost bmc systems.\n\nTesting:\nThis change is tested on Tiogapass and yosemite2 platforms.\n\nSigned-off-by: Naveen Moses <naveen.mosess@hcl.com>\nChange-Id: I95858ec23bac61c718d5feb9733724311ffa38a4\n",

This on its own is not a huge deal, but it makes me believe that the development process was to change \"system\" for the host id, then take a look at what broken and fix things one at a time for power and System.  This kind of approach isn't going to be acceptable for a feature like this, and I have no interest in merging a series that breaks the behavior of the sub-resource groups for a migration as major as this, given that it leads to continued inconsistencies, and is going to require the community to continue to help.\n\nIf your intent with this patch was to start the migration, and show one or two examples of how we could handle these cases better, GREAT!  Love the effort and the attempt to get early feedback on high level design decisions that have impact to a large number of call sites.  Ideally, you would've called this out in the commit message, but eh.\n\nIf the goal for this patchset is \"fix the things that I need and ignore the rest, including the broken routes on my system\" that's not going to work for me.\n\n\nFWIW, I have multi-host Redfish systems coming up in the future, so as you develop code, design docs, or anything else in that realm, feel free to CC me on the reviews for those.  As I have time, I'm even willing to help write patches, you're just a little ahead of us."

As-written, i'm fairly certain this breaks webui-vue because of:\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/webui-vue/issues/43\n\nFWIW, webui-vue maintainers and contributors have had 18 months of warning that this change was coming, and in the meantime have only added more hardcoded resources, so while we should definitely discuss it, those that rely on protocol-ignoring clients can probably come up with ways to fix them in short order once this patch series lands.  I'm not of the mind to require a contributor that's adding things that obey the Redfish spec properly to have to do a bunch of mitigation and testing because one client ignored the spec.

It means that for EVERY computersystem route (of which there are many), we'll need to determine if we're in single system mode, or double system mode, and for people implementing Redfish code on a single system (which are the majority) it's highly likely that they break the multi-host case, especially as we go deep into the tree (ie /redfish/v1/Systems/systemN/LogServices/EventLog/Entries/entryN.  If I'm overestimating the complexity here, please let me know.  Realistically, interface-wise, a single system should look the same as having a single node in a multi-node system.\n\nWhat I'd like to see is an analysis of the existing dbus and filesystem paths for host control that are used within the ComputerSystem tree;  Most of them are going to be called \"xyz/openbmc_project/hostN\" and given that Redfish generally uses the last part of that path as the control, we should be able to just change /redfish/v1/Systems/system to /redfish/v1/Systems/hostN without a problem in the long term.  In the short term, I suspect the best strategy would be to simply string replace \"host0\" with \"system\", so that \"system\" always represents the first node, and for any subsequent paths in the tree, \"system\" will be correct (at least in redfish terms) for both multi-node, and non-multi-node, with \"system\" (ie node0) just supporting more features than the rest of the nodes in the interim.\n\nFrom my perspective this accomplishes:\n1. A reasonably self-contained initial patchset where we can add multi-host support without breaking most of the tree, or having routes that are totally invalid and return 500 on multi-node systems.\n2. A transition path to where individual nodes can be made \"multi host aware\" over time, and we can track our progress toward that goal with a simple\n\ngrep BMCWEB_ROUTE(\"/redfish/v1/Systems/system\n\nAs long as that call returns routes, this feature is still not done, and we still have routes we need to migrate to be multi-node aware (ie \"redfish/v1/Systems/<str>\")\n\n3. Once all the routes have been migrated, we can simply remove the code that replaces host0 with \"system\", the IDs will change, and the tree will still be correct.\n\nThe above is what I have in my mind for a progressing path of this feature, and lets multiple people participate without getting in eachothers way."

                    "message": "> I'm not really interested in maintaining the complexity that this entails of keeping two different naming schemes long term.  It means that for EVERY computersystem route (of which there are many), we'll need to determine if we're in single system mode, or double system mode, and for people implementing Redfish code on a single system (which are the majority) it's highly likely that they break the multi-host case, especially as we go deep into the tree (ie /redfish/v1/Systems/systemN/LogServices/EventLog/Entries/entryN.  If I'm overestimating the complexity here, please let me know.  Realistically, interface-wise, a single system should look the same as having a single node in a multi-node system. \n> \nmy idea is also to keeping single naming scheme by having the single host system with name system0 or host0.\nAnyway as we have to migrate step by step we could keep the \n\"system\" name for single host for this time being.\n\n> What I'd like to see is an analysis of the existing dbus and filesystem paths for host control that are used within the ComputerSystem tree;  Most of them are going to be called \"xyz/openbmc_project/hostN\" and given that Redfish generally uses the last part of that path as the control, we should be able to just change /redfish/v1/Systems/system to /redfish/v1/Systems/hostN without a problem in the long term.  In the short term, I suspect the best strategy would be to simply string replace \"host0\" with \"system\", so that \"system\" always represents the first node, and for any subsequent paths in the tree, \"system\" will be correct (at least in redfish terms) for both multi-node, and non-multi-node, with \"system\" (ie node0) just supporting more features than the rest of the nodes in the interim.\n\nIn my understanding Computer system tree is divided in the following two subparts:\n\n1.Inventory items such as processors,RAM,storage,BIOS etc\n\nThese items are populated by probing the common inventory interfaces\nsuch as xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Dimm,\nxyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Cpu etc.\n\nMy understanding is to gather the inventory item info at is redfish level\nprobing with these common inventory interfaces and filter the results based on host number. \n\nPopulating the inventory item details under the respective dbus inventory \npath should be done separately and it is not within the scope of redfish.\n\n2.Host Power control and host state components\n\nalmost all of the dbus object system paths associated with host control are having the same prefix \"xyz/openbmc_project/hostN\" as you have mentioned.\n\nso this gerrit patch implemented host number based dbus object path in the \"systems.hpp\" and we have verified the applicable host control actions in our platform.\n\n> \n> From my perspective this accomplishes:\n> 1. A reasonably self-contained initial patchset where we can add multi-host support without breaking most of the tree, or having routes that are totally invalid and return 500 on multi-node systems.\n> 2. A transition path to where individual nodes can be made \"multi host aware\" over time, and we can track our progress toward that goal with a simple\n> \n> grep BMCWEB_ROUTE(\"/redfish/v1/Systems/system\n> \n> As long as that call returns routes, this feature is still not done, and we still have routes we need to migrate to be multi-node aware (ie \"redfish/v1/Systems/<str>\")\n> \n> 3. Once all the routes have been migrated, we can simply remove the code that replaces host0 with \"system\", the IDs will change, and the tree will still be correct.\n> \n> The above is what I have in my mind for a progressing path of this feature, and lets multiple people participate without getting in eachothers way.\n\nI think this change is in line with your proposal as well. I also think doing initial changes in systems.hpp is right start. If any specific change or deviation needed in the code, please let me know I will correct them."

Lets keep system0/host0 defined as \"system\" at a redfish level and follow the path I laid out, unless I'm over complicating it, but I've looked at it a bit in https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/53816 so i suspect this is a better way, and keeps most code consistent, and we can have a consistent rule in the meantime."
