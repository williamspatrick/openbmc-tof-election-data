    "commitMessage": "functions: Remove GetObject to check if PLDM is running\n\nIn order to check if PLDM is running, the code was subscribing to Name\nOwner change and calling GetObject to see if PLDM was running, but PLDM\nstarts and does not immediately create its Object Manager, therefore\nthere is a time window when if PLDM starts but hasn't created its Object\nManager, and the openpower service starts, it'll hang forever waiting\nfor the Name Owner change signal that will not be sent because PLDM\nalready started.\n\nInstead of calling GetObject, just attempt to run the callback, in this\ncase setting the bios attribute, and forward the exception if it fails\n(due to PLDM not running and the property not existing in D-Bus yet),\nso that the openpower service continues to wait. Change the log severity\nto informational since setting the bios attribute will fail if PLDM has\nnot started yet.\n\nTested: Stopped the PLDM and Entity Manager services and started these\nservices and the openpower service in various different orders to verify\nthe openpower service ran when both PLDM and EM had started.\n\nChange-Id: Idd2f344beda8dfcf2b987b3cab6f8967c63cab4c\nSigned-off-by: Adriana Kobylak <anoo@us.ibm.com>\n",
