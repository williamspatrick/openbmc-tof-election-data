Seems we're the only component using prev_entry() by searching the openbmc repos, so I'd agree to move the error log. In the past we've seen race conditions where the metadata didn't make it to the journal in time for the prev_entry() function to find it, seems it's now very consistent.\n\nApr 26 20:25:25 p10bmc phosphor-image-updater[10603]: TEST: BMC Minimum Ship Level (0429) NOT met by 0999\n...\nApr 26 20:25:30 p10bmc phosphor-image-updater[10603]: A system component has a software version that is incompatible as determined by the implementation and needs to be updated.
