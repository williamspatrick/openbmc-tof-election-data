    "commitMessage": "IpmbSensor:Add bus index for multiple IPMB bus\n\nIPMB bus is a physical bus which is exposed using IPMB driver. IPMB\nis an I2c based serial bus that interconnects the baseboard and\nchassis management.\n\nA BMC that includes IPMB interface support and also provides the\ncapability for system software to send and receive messages to\nand from the IPMB using the BMC as a kind of communication\ncontroller.\n\nIn OCP multi-host platform, multiple IPMB bus support is present.\nTherefore, for each config, IPMB bus value will be passed from\nentity-manager json config file.\n\nThrough this IPMB bus, BMC will send and receive messages and then\nstore the response for each configuration.\n\nExample :\n        {\n            \"Address\": \"0x01\",\n            \"Bus\": \"$bus\",\n            \"Name\": \"Temp_Sensor\",\n            \"Type\": \"IpmbSensor\"\n        }\n\nIn the current patchset, only IPMB bus value is read and further\nimplementation using this value will be done in the following\npatchset.\n\nSDR Sensor :\n https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/52164\n https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/38905\n\nIPMB GPIO State :\n https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/47952\n\nTESTED: Tested on Facebook YosemiteV2 hardware and verified the\nIPMB bus value.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jayashree Dhanapal <jayashree-d@hcl.com>\nChange-Id: I0a47057da98ee81471ac9f6fac69a036853db7d1\n",
