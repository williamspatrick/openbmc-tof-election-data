    "commitMessage": "PEL: Minimize peltool deps: pel.cpp\n\nThis is the first in a chain of commits to minimize the dependencies\nnecessary to build the peltool application to those only necessary to\nparse PELs so that it is easier to build and distribute outside of the\nBMC.\n\nThe classes that are used to represent a PEL and its sections are used\nin both the daemon when a PEL is created as well as by peltool to create\nthe PEL objects from the PEL files so they can be pretty printed.  The\npeltool use case doesn't require D-Bus\n(sdbusplus/phosphor-dbus-interfaces) so any functions that use it can be\ncompiled out when being built for peltool.\n\nBesides removing D-Bus, the phosphor-logging log<>() functions will be\nconverted to use the trace wrapper functions from trace.hpp in any code\nthat peltool uses so peltool can build on systems that don't necessarily\nuse the systemd journal, like AIX.\n\nFor now, the code that prints the PEL and its sections in JSON, possibly\nby calling python modules to help, will be left in the daemon as there\nis a good chance it will need to support that functionality in the\nfuture.\n\nThis commit does the above for pel.cpp/hpp\n\nAn alternative would have been to refactor the code to separate out the\nPEL creation and display into separate objects and then include just the\nnecessary ones into the daemon and peltool.  The current method was\nchosen as it was less of a rip up and I felt it leaves the code more\nreadable as all functionality for a PEL section can be in a single class\nand file.\n\nSigned-off-by: Matt Spinler <spinler@us.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: I550de24c6797f74d41c4d98dbed510f4cfef64b0\n",
