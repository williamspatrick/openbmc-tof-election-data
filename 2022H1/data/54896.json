    "commitMessage": "Redfish Aggregation: Aggregate Collections\n\nAdds aggregation support for resource collections that take the form\nof \"/redfish/v1/<resource collection>\".  Collection URIs are\nidentified by the precense of a \"Members\" array in the response.\n\nResources from satellite BMCs are added to the \"Members\" array of\nthe response and the \"Members@odata.count\" value is updated to\ndenote the new array size.\n\nThese satellite resource URIs that are added also include the\nprefix associated with that satellite.\n\nNote that as a first step this patch assumes a single satellite BMC.\nThere are some potential race conditions that could occur for setups\nwith multiple satellite BMCs.  This has been commented in the code\nand is better left to its own patch.\n\nTested:\nQueried various collection URIs and the aggregated resources\nappeared in the response's \"Members\" array.\n\nQuerying 'localhost:80/redfish/v1/Chassis?$expand=.($levels=1)'\nresulted in $expand correctly returning the outputs from querying\nthe URIs of all local and satellite Chassis resources.  This would\nhave failed if the satellite Chassis resources were omitted from the\n\"Members\" array or the satellite's prefix was not correctly added to\nthe URI.\n\nAlso queried a collection URI that only existed on the satellite BMC.\nThe AsyncResp was completely overwritten by the response from the\nsatellite BMC.\n\nQueries to non-collection URIs resulted in no attempts to add\nsatellite responses to the AsyncResp.\n\nSigned-off-by: Carson Labrado <clabrado@google.com>\nChange-Id: I3b379cd57e5a121eb4a344d88fc8e43170ca78a6\n",

I forget if boost::beast::fields follows stl here, but I suspect it would.\n\nAs a safety check, we also need to check content-encoding.  in the context of this patch, feel free to just bail out if content-encoding is set to anything, but we don't want to accidentally parse a gzip payload as json, as it could give security vulnerabillities."
