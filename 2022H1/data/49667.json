    "commitMessage": "RFC: Remove uses of boost::flat_map\n\nI was reading something that said vector based containers generate more\ncode than node based ones, so I ran an experiment, and swapped all of\nbmcwebs maps with std::map.\n\nThis saves 34KB of compressed binary size, or about 2.5% of bmcwebs\ncompiled size.  A number of these uses of flat_map probably don't need\nto be maps at all.  In terms of tradeoffs, this is almost certainly\nslower than the flat_maps, but it's quite possible that it's in the\nnoise compared to dbus.  I'm looking for some other peoples thoughts on\ntradeoffs here.\n\nTested: WIP, no tests done.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: If2dcb3d0344267577809dc05b4dd086de6d012cf\n",

For small maps I think it trends towards O(n sqrt n).  And yes, I know that saying \"for small maps ... O(n sqrt n)\" makes no sense anyhow because Big-O is about asymptotic behavior, but hopefully it makes sense in this context."

We originally (over) used flat_map because of a belief and measurements that it caused less memory fragmentation, and for systems without a lot of extra ram, it \"mattered\".  Also, given the abysmal memory bandwidth and tiny cache size on the aspeed 2400, pulling fewer cold memory pages to do this kind of thing seemed to help.\n\n>Iteration:\n> map - O(n lg n)\n\nnit: Map is O(n) for iteration, isn't it?

I was too simple in my algorithmic analysis I did in my head.\n\nA single iteration step can take up to O(lg n) steps because you can have to go all the way up the tree and back down another leg.  So I did a simple O(n nodes * lg n traversals) in my head.\n\nSince the number of edges scales with n, and you have to traverse every edge exactly twice, the amortized analysis of iteration is still O(n) on map even if individual iteration steps are not O(1)."
