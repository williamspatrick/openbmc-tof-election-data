Alternatively you could have marked it WIP until the CCLA is submitted.\n\n> BTW, will both patches and merge requestes be accepted by openbmc project?\n\nI don't know what you mean by this question.  We generally only accept contributions via Gerrit, which is neither PRs or patches.\n\nA very few repositories we maintain are forks of upstream repositories, such as openbmc/linux, and those follow their upstream process.  In the case of Linux kernel contributions they do go as patches to the openbmc mailing list.\n\nIf the repository is in Gerrit, use Gerrit.  If it is not in Gerrit but on openbmc's Github organization it probably uses the mailing list as patches.

I am unable to access the CCLA link given by openbmc, could you send me a copy of the CCLA?\n> \n> > BTW, will both patches and merge requestes be accepted by openbmc project?\n> \n> I don't know what you mean by this question.  We generally only accept contributions via Gerrit, which is neither PRs or patches.\n\nI am sorry for making you confusion. Merge request means that using the command \"push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/master\". I am not sure PRs is the same meanings with MRs(merge requestes). If they are different, this commit will be sent to openbmc repository in form of patches.\n>  \n> A very few repositories we maintain are forks of upstream repositories, such as openbmc/linux, and those follow their upstream process.
