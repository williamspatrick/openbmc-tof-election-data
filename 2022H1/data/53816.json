    "commitMessage": "RFC: Make routes start matching Redfish\n\nThis is preliminary patch to set up the route handling such that it's\nready for the addition of multiple hosts, multiple managers in the\nfuture.  Routes previously took the form of\n\n/redfish/v1/Systems/system\n\nwhich essentially hardcoded the name \"system\" into a number of places.\nAs the stack evolves to support multiple systems, this needs to change.\n\nThis patchset changes all the ComputerSystem resources to the form:\n/redfish/v1/Systems/<str>\n\nand adds 404 checks to each route such that they will be handled\nproperly still.  This means that as we evolve our multi-host support,\neach individual route can be moved one at a time to support multi-host.\n\n/redfish/v1/Managers/bmc is in a similar boat, and this commit moves\nSOME of those routes over to the same pattern to prove that it can be\ndone.\n\nIn the future, moving these to redfish-spec-defined routing would likely\nmeant that we could generate this code in the future at some point,\nwhich reduces the likelihood that people do it incorrectly.\n\nThis patch currently sets the resource id and resource type in the\nresourceNotFound message to empty string (\"\").  This handling is still\narguably more correct than what we had before, which just returned 404\nwith an empty payload, although in the future will need to be corrected\nover time.\n\nTested: None yet.  RFC to see if this is a pattern we'd like to\npropogate\n\nSigned-off-by: Ed Tanous <edtanous@google.com>\nChange-Id: If9c07ad69f5287bb054645f460d7e370d433dc27\n",
