System power off.\n   Remove power from powersupply2 and powersupply3.\n   Power system on.\n   Without changes:\n       Two 110015F0 PELs.\n       One 110015F7 PEL.\n       SAI LED on.\n       powersupply2 Health critical, LED on.\n       powersupply3 Health critical, LED off.\n   With changes:\n       Two 110015F0 PELs.\n       SAI LED on.\n       powersupply2 Health critical, LED off.\n       powersupply3 Health critical, LED off.\n   Resolve input power issue.\n      Without Changes:\n       powersupply2 Health critical, LED on.\n       powersupply3 Health Okay.\n      With Changes:\n       powersupply2 Health Okay.\n       powersupply3 Health Okay.\n   Attempt resolve input power with wrong voltage:\n      With Changes:\n        powersupply0 called out in 110015F7.

If AC returns only after the timer expires, sounds like we wouldn't tell the customer they have an invalid config at any point.  \n\nOptimally, when AC returned, we would do the validation then.  Can we, once the timer expires, try to do the validation then (assuming we haven't already validated it), and if AC is still gone, kick the timer off again or something like that (or any other options)?\n\nThis is a double-failure scenario so if it's too complex so be it, but if it's an easy fix, that would be the desired behavior (eventually telling them invalid config if it is the case)."
