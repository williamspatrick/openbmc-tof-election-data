I've posted concerns around doing this in separate apps here as well as in https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/46346. My suggestion would be implement this in openbmc/pldm, wherein PLDM Requester work is happening already (Type 5 commits are on Gerrit). We have plans on implementing Type 2 next, but I think your code can be easily migrated to openbmc/pldm."

The Fru information would be present in the frurecord Table of the remote PLDM terminus, and the FRU Recordset identifiers would be coming from the fru recordSet PDR's of the remote terminus - what is the role of the Entity association PDR's here ?\n\nThe proposal assumes tid is assigned by pldmd so pldmd knows the mapping of TID/EID. When pldmd fetches PDRs by GetPDR command from a PLDM terminus, pldmd also knows which EID returns the PDRs and what value of terminus handle is in each PDRs. So pldmd should be able to maintain a mapping table for terminus_handle/eid/tid.\n\nWhen pldmd parses the Entity association PDRs for a PLDM terminus, it can create dbus objects for all entities defined in PDRs in a hierarchical dbus paths(/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Source/PLDM/<TID>/<INSTANCE#>/<INSTANCE#>/...) and then implements Entity.interface and FRU.interface to these dbus objects.\n\n> Multiple PLDM entities from the same pldm terminus can have the same entity instance number. if that is the case, the dbus paths will not be unique.\n\nMy idea is that the instance# should be unique under the same container ID. The dbus path of child entity cascades its instance# after its parent's dbus path string.\n\nExample:\nA PLDM terminus assigned TID to 1. Its Entity Association PDR describes the containerID=123 under contrainerID=SYSTEM and there are two entities belong to containerID=123. So the dbus path for these three entities are created like below.\n\n/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Source/PLDM/1/\n/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Source/PLDM/1/1\n/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Source/PLDM/1/2"

However, as you mentioned that the current implementation of mctp-demux-deamon does not act as MCTP responder.\n\nI think pldmd can have a wrapper interface to abstract the method of getting EID table from MCTP service. One of possible implementation can be the method you suggested. It is also provide the flexibility to adopt to other new MCTP service implementation(e.g. in-kernel MCTP)"

But GetRoutingTableEntries is MCTP command. It is handled by libmctp and routing table is managed in mctp layer. The problem is how libmctp response the routing table to pldmd?\n\nCurrently, mctp is trasporter for pldm message. it does not handle pldm message ( does not parse pldm message). So I think libmctp will not response for the request from libpldm."

The config file defines rules how to mapping sensor# in a PLDM terminus to practical name. Each rule has FRU matching keywords like what entity-manager does. 'pldmd' can decide which rule should apply to which PLDM terminus. For the case that more than one the same PLDM terminus installed in platform, the sensor names for second and following terminus will be have a suffix instance# of PLDM terminus.\n\nThe cons: It is introducing another config file to increase maintenance effort.\nThe pros: It avoids the dependency on EM and the D-Bus calls."

Is there any mechanism to supply configuration \n> from EM (or provided in pldmd) to give better names on these?\nThe idea of using location decorator(https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Decorator/LocationCode.interface.yaml) mentioned by Sumanth might be helpful here. Since, PLDM will always have a transport layer below, it might be always good if that transport can give the information related to physical location of the device. And it is easy and straightforward for a transport layer to expose this info. \n\nEg: In MCTP over I2C binding, mctpd will have the information about the device slave address or bus number in which it is connected to. With an entity manager config we can easily name and map that bus as say 'PCIe slot 1' and expose it as LocationCode. Now pldmd can consume the same and prepend to sensor name, then fan control can easily map corresponding fans with the same.\n\nIf PLDM has static EID config, then this info can be part of that config as well."

                    "message": "> Eg: In MCTP over I2C binding, mctpd will have the information about the device slave address or bus number in which it is connected to. With an entity manager config we can easily name and map that bus as say 'PCIe slot 1' and expose it as LocationCode. Now pldmd can consume the same and prepend to sensor name, then fan control can easily map corresponding fans with the same.\n\nThe MCTP endpoint D-Bus interface(https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/MCTP/Endpoint.interface.yaml) doesn't have properties for its transport layer physical media type/address of its transport layer. It might be good to expose this info here to implement the idea of location decorator mentioned by Sumanth. \n\nIn MCTP over I2C binding, the Slave address for endpoint can be fixed or dynamic assignment(SMBus ARP). Entity manager config can easily map endpoint for fixed address but hard for dynamic assignment. If we can assumed that all PCI slots in system has its dedicated I2C bus number(might be connected to different BMC's I2C bus or divided by I2C-MUX), then using I2C bus number should be enough for pldmd to map sensor name."

But since mux address is static, entity manager can easily map the given bus address to PCIe Slot 1, PCIe Slot 2 etc.."
