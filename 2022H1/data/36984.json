Also, it means that the generated test files can no longer be used to build/look at an example implementation of a machine anymore, and I think that's important to be able to compare exact machines.\n\nI would be hard against any kind of fuzzy matching.  The only exception I see could be for sensors values, which are expected to vary a bit, but those are going to be a range, not a regex."

You can specify where you want the logs to go, and the tool will write them there, be it an NFS share, an sshfs implementation, or just a tmpfs in ram, I'd like the tool not to be in charge of that to keep it simple."
